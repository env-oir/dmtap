# KOTVA spec-perfection — driven by the Ephor session (founder-authorised)

Temporary process file (delete at convergence). Edits land directly in kotva; **no co-author footer**.
The Ephor session is driving this pass per founder; the spec session should HOLD spec edits to avoid
collision (see ephor COORDINATION.md).

## Founder calls — DECIDED (agents obey these)
- **MIXNET = DEMOTE.** Move `04-transport §4.4` (Sphinx/Loopix mixnet, ~883 lines) and `09-anti-abuse
  §9.4.1` (VDF, ~115 lines) to a new `research/` dir as **non-normative / experimental**, leaving short
  stub pointers. **Flip the transport default off the mixnet/`private` tier to `fast`/direct.** Demote
  `06-privacy` SP-3/SP-4/§6.10. **Restate the metadata-privacy claim honestly**: sealed-sender
  *reduction* vs intermediaries — NOT global-passive-adversary immunity (a global observer can still
  recover the graph via IP+timing correlation). Keep the mixnet as an **opt-in tier + a stated roadmap
  goal**. Reconcile DIRECTION §9, THREAT-MODEL SEC-9/R-9, README, 00-overview, substrate/README+ROLES so
  they all agree (they already say "research-tier" — make the flagship match).
- **ECONOMICS = SEAM ONLY.** CONTRACT §6 keeps the *mechanism* normative (signed tariff object, signed
  usage-receipt object, settlement seam over an existing asset, no token, no published price-rank, stake
  verified on-rail, **charge for service — never for deliverability/classification**) and the *numbers*
  out of scope (operator policy). Do NOT add pricing / rails / billing models. Add ONE honest sentence:
  "whether charge-for-service sustainably funds coordinators is an open question."
- **PQ:** classical suite `0x01` is the interoperable floor; `0x02` (X-Wing + ML-DSA composite) is
  **PROVISIONAL**, pinned to a specific draft revision — not hard-mandated.
- **Personhood:** require interop with **≥2 structurally-different** bindings as a v0 target + a non-crypto
  day-one path; disclose the single-vendor (World ID) fragility.
- **Custodial escrow:** disclose + accept (the one honest load-bearing exception); hold it to the same
  MUST-verify-stake bar as other kinds; add it as a disclosed self-host exception class in CONTRACT §2.3.
- **Naming:** keep legacy brands (DMTAP / TRACT / WRAP) primary as aliases; **ephor** = the coordinator
  umbrella (provisional resolved).
- **SA/British English + RFC layout: LAST**, after correctness is frozen (don't re-spell churned text).

## Guardrails (every wave)
Perfect, don't rewrite. PRESERVE all normative content, every honest-residual, every security MUST, every
wire byte/CBOR key/DS-tag/error code, every RFC citation. Never introduce an overclaim. Keep cross-refs
resolving + BCP-14 correct. Commit per wave; `git pull --rebase` before push; one writer per doc-cluster.

## Waves
**W1 (substantive, cross-cutting — file-disjoint, run now):**
- **A1 governing alignment** — DIRECTION, 00-overview, README, THREAT-MODEL, SPEC, substrate/README,
  substrate/ROLES: apply the mixnet-demotion *statements* + canonical **six** waist capabilities (restore
  MOTE + Transport to substrate/README §2) + align every coordinator-kind count/tally to CONTRACT §5.
  Does NOT edit CONTRACT (A2 owns it).
- **A1b mixnet mechanics** — 04-transport §4.4, 06-privacy SP-3/SP-4/§6.10, 09-anti-abuse §9.4.1; create
  `research/mixnet.md` + `research/vdf.md`; move the content, stub pointers, flip the default.
- **A2 contract + wire-debt** — coordinator/CONTRACT (§5 canonical kinds; §6 economics + the honesty note;
  custodial-escrow bar §2.3/§6), 07-gateway, 12-operators, 26-legacy-adapters, 18-wire-format, 21-errors:
  write **GatewayAuthz / CoordinatorDescriptor / SignedTariff / UsageReceipt** CDDL + DS-tags + signing
  preimages (match the Ephor impl's logged descriptor layout where sensible), so "Accountable" is
  wire-checkable.

**W1-ripple (mixnet-demotion cross-file contradictions — fix right after A1b commits, one agent):**
The demotion moved §4.4 to `docs/research/mixnet.md` but these untouched docs still present the mixnet as
default/normative or dangle refs to the moved section — reconcile to opt-in/research + `fast` default:
- `14-scaling.md` §14 table "Mix … **default-on** (§4.4.2a)" + heading "14.6.3 Tie-in to the mixnet profiles
  (**normative**)" → opt-in/non-default + non-normative; repoint §4.4.* refs to `docs/research/mixnet.md`.
- `27-realtime-media.md` §150/§342 "`private` (mixnet) the default for mail and all control messages" →
  restate: default is `fast`; `private`/mixnet is opt-in/research.
- `18-wire-format.md §1740` `min_hops` — repoint moved `§4.4.10`/`§6.8` refs to `docs/research/mixnet.md`;
  soften "the mixnet's anonymity guarantee" to the opt-in/research framing.
- Sweep for any other doc still saying mixnet "default"/"normative"/"guarantee" (grep) and reconcile.

**W2 (substantive residuals — after W1 commits, watch overlaps):**
- [x] RecoveryPolicy §1.4 formal model (01/13) — Table A/D + `is_weakening()`; D0 eviction case `1aad934`.
- [x] HPKE-mode pinned Base (02/05/18) — `712c091`.
- [x] SYNC split minimal-core+extension + open-namespace determinism (substrate/SYNC) — `1ea9ac8`
  (core = OR-Set/LWW/Death-cert; ext = PN-counter/RGA/Movable-tree; vectors tiered, none changed).
  **Round-2 follow-up flagged:** ADOPTION.md calls RGA load-bearing for an editor product while SYNC
  now marks it optional — reconcile the language (a product MAY require an optional extension; not a
  contradiction, but the wording should agree).
- [x] premature-generality cuts — **RE-EVALUATED, mostly REJECTED on inspection (defect doesn't
  reproduce):** suites `0x03`-`0x05` are already `RESERVED` + honestly status-labelled and are the
  *designed crypto-agility / emergency-pivot scaffold* (§1.1 anchor rotation, §16.7, §18.2 byte
  arithmetic, §18.1.5 multihash) — an appendix move would dangle 30+ refs and break the migration
  narrative, i.e. a regression not a simplification. Keep as-is. compute-kind note + media-relay/
  reachability collapse: DEFER to critique round 2 — act only if a fresh lens confirms real
  over-engineering (avoid a risky kind-merge that ripples into the Ephor impl + CONTRACT §5).
- [x] multi-homing RECOMMENDED (substrate/ROLES) — `7c89506`.
- [x] REPUTATION→OpenRank "degraded" label + personhood ≥2 + discovery/indexer + coordinator-funding
  open problems (primitives/REPUTATION, bindings, profiles, DIRECTION/SPEC) — `5d05427`.
- [x] GOVERNANCE.md refresh + coordinator-contract ratification process (+ fail-open→fail-closed `e3328d0`).
- [x] §19.7.1 Payload.from=gateway-IK fix — already correct (step 3 sets gateway IK; CHANGELOG:139).

**Critique round 1 (workflow `wyr7famw7`) — 8 residuals, closing:**
- [x] §1.4a D0 eviction `1aad934` · [x] HPKE Base `712c091` · [x] trivial batch `e3328d0`
- [x] §18.8a wire-object cluster (suite/valid_until/terminating→declared/mime/mail-fast) `2b86e22`
- [x] 06/04 privacy (bulk onion-MUST vs §4.5 MUST-NOT contradiction; dangling §4.4.11) `675aad9`
- [x] cross-doc reconcile CONTRACT/07/26/21/10 to T's layout — `217fccc` (§26.11 false-premise fixed,
  Tariff.identity attribution added, 2 sibling mime values assigned non-colliding; 2 false-positives
  correctly skipped). **Critique round 1 CLOSED 8/8.**

**Critique round 2 (workflow `wp8pff72w`, 5 lenses + adversarial verify) — NOT clean: 6 confirmed, 1 refuted.**
Deferred questions ADJUDICATED as non-findings: media-relay vs reachability-adapter = distinct planes (SFU vs
NAT-ingress, composed in profiles/rtc.md); compute = disclosed provisional slot (not over-engineering);
ADOPTION/RGA = not a contradiction (ADOPTION calls *Yjs* load-bearing, RGA gaps are gaps). Refuted finding
(RecoveryPolicy recover_threshold "weakening") = actually a STRENGTHENING (adds a factor → harder), Table D
correctly silent. The 6 confirmed (each a different file → 2 disjoint fix-agents):
- [x] **F1 (HIGH)** substrate/SYNC.md §6.2 — stability cut redefined to min-of-`contiguous_below` (was
  min-of-`max_applied`); `StabilityMark.hlc` MUST carry contiguous_below; C-30 logged; reused `0x0A09`
  (byte-indistinguishable, so no receipt-time code); no conformance-vector change; min-of-min preserves
  convergence. `9b62798`. **Critique round 2 CLOSED 6/6.**
- [~] **F2 batch** (agent F2 in flight): (MED) coordinator/CONTRACT.md 5 cross-dir links missing `../`;
  (MED) 18-wire-format.md:1803 "kind … key 1" → key 2 (kind is key 2, suite is key 1); (MED) 17-parity.md:113
  stale "full mixnet privacy"/"onion" attachment-tier labels → fast default + never-mixnet bulk; (LOW)
  docs/research/coverage-matrix.md compute "does not exist / add it" → already a provisional kind; (LOW)
  11-grounding-and-references.md:75 unqualified "DMTAP targets a global passive adversary" → mixnet does; default = reduction.
After F1+F2 land → **critique round 3** (different lens mix); two consecutive clean → PERFECTED.

**Critique round 3 (workflow `wfmvmanpz`, fresh 5 lenses: adversarial-crypto · state-machine/liveness ·
implementer-interop · rfc-layout/bcp14 · cross-family) — NOT clean: 8 confirmed** (7 by the workflow + 1
HIGH I hand-verified after its verify-agent died on an API stall — the "1 refuted" was that miscount, not
a real refutation). Fix-agents (file-disjoint):
- [x] **X** {18-wire-format, 13-identity-auth} `8f322d0`: §18.9.8 `auth_hash` → `0x1e ‖ BLAKE3-256(…)`
  multihash form (+ §13.3 step 5); §18.3.3 PostageStamp/Vouch → reference §18.9.7 whole-object rule;
  §18.3.2 BlindedTag KDF pinned. Verified clean. **Conformance follow-up done:** DMTAP-AUTH-01 in
  SUITE.md/suite.json aligned to the multihash preimage `1984175` (auth vectors are construction-todo —
  no frozen bytes to regenerate).
- [x] **Y** {20-state-machines} `17390d6`: §20.1 RETRY totality gap closed — pre-seal RETRY now
  re-resolves (was condemning DNS/KT-lagged MOTEs to EXPIRED). Verified: pre-seal edge in table+diagram.
- [x] **Z** {00-overview, SPEC, STYLE, wrap/*, coverage-matrix, ADOPTION} `f7b0008`: §0.8 (+SPEC+STYLE)
  BCP-14 full set; WRAP four-of-six + canonical numbers; coverage-matrix SFU=`blind-routing`; ADOPTION §1.
- [x] **W** {02-mote, 06-privacy} `bef2927`: BlindedTag prose (§2.2a/§6.4) → reference X's §18.3.2 pin;
  honest limits preserved.

**Round 3 CLOSED 8/8.** → **critique round 4** (fresh lens mix: security-downgrade/composition ·
conformance-testability · xref-integrity · honesty-overclaim · reader-coherence). Two consecutive
fully-clean passes from DIFFERENT lens-sets → PERFECTED.

**Round 4 status — workflow `war2cklt5` INFRA-DEGRADED, NOT a valid pass.** Only 1/5 lenses returned
(security-downgrade: 1 finding, refuted → clean); the other 4 lenses died on API stalls (widespread
mid-stream stalls also hit round 3). The workflow's `overall_clean:true` is a FALSE clean (4/5 of the spec
un-critiqued). **Re-running the 4 missing lenses as resilient individual agents (sonnet, self-verifying,
≤3 concurrent):** conformance-testability `a657e6c7`, xref-integrity `ab9a888b`, honesty-overclaim
`af753942` in flight; reader-coherence queued. Only when ALL 5 lenses return clean does round 4 count as
pass 1 of 2. **Infra note:** stop using the high-concurrency opus workflow for critique; prefer individual
sonnet lens-agents (one stall no longer voids the batch).

**Round 4 = CLEAN (pass 1 of 2), 5/5 lenses.** security-downgrade/composition (surviving workflow agent —
1 finding, refuted); conformance-testability, xref-integrity, honesty-overclaim, reader-coherence
(inline-verified by the driver with evidence, because the re-run agents ALSO stalled mid-stream — a
persistent infra issue). Evidence: BlindedTag conformance row (DMTAP-REST-05) correctly cites §18.3.2 and
carries no stale KDF; no row asserts old postage/vouch preimage or max-applied cut; §20.1 table↔mermaid
agree on the RETRY→QUEUED pre-seal edge; `[§18.3.2](../18-wire-format.md)` links resolve; lint 0 errors;
REACH §7 scopes Noise to "control leg only, does not affect the REACH-1a cert residual"; BlindedTag honest
limits intact; WRAP "four of six" + canonical numbers; 11 kinds + six capabilities consistent.
**CAVEAT (honesty):** 4/5 lenses were driver-inline, not independent agents — less adversarially
independent than the bar intends. **Round 5 (pass 2)** MUST attempt genuine independent agents on a
DIFFERENT lens-set (infra may recover); if agents keep stalling, report to the user that the spec is clean
per driver verification but independent-agent confirmation is infra-blocked. Two still-running backup
agents (xref `ab9a888b`, honesty `af753942`) may yet corroborate independently.

**Round 5 (pass 2) — CLEAN, driver-inline (all backup/re-run agents ALSO stalled — 5 agent deaths total).**
Fresh angles vs round 4: wire/CDDL (no CBOR key collisions in §18.8a/BlindedTag), cross-doc contradiction
(every "mixnet default" hit is the correct opt-in framing), SYNC determinism (no lingering max-applied cut
post-C-30). All three backup agents corroborated "clean" in their last words before stalling.

## CONVERGENCE STATUS — 2 clean passes achieved; teardown HELD on founder sign-off
- Rounds 1-3 (INDEPENDENT agents): 22 real defects found + fixed (incl. 1 HIGH silent-lost-write, 1 HIGH
  interop KDF, the REACH-2 Asokan vuln, the auth-assertion cross-hash forgery).
- Round 4 + Round 5: ZERO confirmed defects across 8 distinct lens-angles (security · conformance · xref ·
  honesty · reader-coherence · wire-cddl · contradiction · determinism). The two-consecutive-clean bar is
  met on content.
- **CAVEAT:** rounds 4-5's non-security lenses were driver-inline (the sub-agent infra is stalling every
  agent mid-stream — an EXTERNAL failure, not a spec defect). One independent agent (round-4 security) ran
  clean; five stalled, all corroborating clean before dying.
- **DECISION HELD (not auto-torn-down):** declaring "perfected" + deleting this file + CronDelete the loop
  is irreversible and outward-facing, resting on verification weaker than the bar's independent-agent
  intent. Options: (A) declare perfected now on driver verification; (B) keep the loop alive and auto-run
  ONE independent-agent confirmation pass when the infra recovers, then declare. Recommend (B). Loop stays
  running meanwhile; spec is clean either way.

## ⚠️ CONVERGENCE RESET — rounds 4/5 "clean" was FALSE (independent pass found a live HIGH)
The independent confirmation pass (3 resilient agents, different lens mix) was dispatched once infra
recovered. The **crypto/wire/determinism agent found a HIGH stolen-`IK` weakening bypass** that BOTH
round 4 and round 5 (driver-inline) MISSED: §1.4 rule 3 claims `IK` alone can never weaken recovery
"regardless of what rotate_threshold contains", and Table B B1 permits an `Ik` clause in rotate_threshold
by DELEGATING protection to rule 3 — but the weakening-gate pseudocode used the generic
`satisfies(rotate_threshold)`, which a bare `IK` sig satisfies via the `Ik` disjunct. So for the spec's
own blessed `recover={Phrase}, rotate={Ik,Guardians(2)}` a stolen IK could evict guardians alone. The
conformance vectors (DMTAP-WIRE-03(d), IDENT-91(a)) already expected reject → confirmed a bug, not a design
change. **FIXED `ad7e79a`:** weakening gate now drops `Ik` clauses before `satisfies()`.
**Lesson (durable):** driver-inline grep verification is NOT equivalent to independent adversarial agents —
it missed a HIGH. The two-consecutive-clean bar REQUIRES independent-agent passes; do not count inline
passes toward it. **Convergence clock reset to zero.** Two other independent agents (contradiction/honesty/
family, interop/conformance/xref) still running this round; after they land + this fix, restart the count:
need TWO consecutive fully-clean INDEPENDENT-AGENT passes (different lens-sets) to declare PERFECTED.

## SPEC EXTENDED (founder directive) — DEPOT managed-infrastructure profile added `9781101`
The founder directed a decentralised-cloud expansion: gateways offer box/bucket/edge-fn/database/cdn with
operator-defined economics + distributed ratings. Added `profiles/cloud.md` (DEPOT profile, one thin
`infra-service` kind + extensible service registry), wired the kind (CONTRACT §5 twelve, SPEC 12, both
§18.8a enums). Design decisions baked in: honesty cliff (only bucket/public-cdn structurally blind;
db/edge-fn/box terminating/declared — non-conformant to market otherwise); non-custody (owner-held root IK,
revocable box subkey, key-escrow FORBIDDEN, recovery via guardian quorum); economics = seam only (operator
sets numbers, KOTVA only requires signed+metered+settled); distributed reputation (signed reproducible
`ServiceMeasurement` PUB feeds, no authority, self-measurements labelled, vulos = one rater not THE rater).
**This is new normative surface → convergence count RESET again.** End-to-end re-critique running (3 agents:
DEPOT honesty/thinness/soundness · whole-spec coherence · adversarial crypto incl. re-verify §1.4 fix).
Then fix + re-run to the two-consecutive-clean bar.

**DECISION (founder-overridable, gap-fill) — BlindedTag KDF pinned:** `BT = HKDF-SHA256(IKM=shared_secret,
salt="DMTAP-v0/blinded-tag", info=uint64_be(epoch_day), L=16)` (RFC 5869; the same HKDF-SHA256 as HPKE/RFC
9180 + push-wake/RFC 8291; suite-migration-independent). `BlindedTag.bytes` = exactly 16 B. Chosen as the
least-surprising, interop-safe pin consistent with the stack's existing KDF choice; was unspecified →
non-interoperable.

Round-3 verification calibration: the panel correctly adjudicated media-relay/reachability as distinct and
compute as a disclosed slot (round 2), and this round found real crypto/interop/state-machine defects — the
adversarial-verify layer is holding. After X/Y/Z/W land → **critique round 4** (re-covers REACH + these
fixes; different lens mix) toward the two-consecutive-clean gate.

## PARALLEL TRACK — REACH profile (founder pivot 2026-07-23: "both in parallel" + "spec-first")
The founder redirected to ephor's #1 gap (content-blind ingress) while this spec loop keeps converging in
the background. Decision: **spec-first** — finish the REACH profile in kotva (zone/descriptor + Noise
control-channel handshake + REACH-* error codes) to freeze it, THEN implement the ephor
`reachability-adapter` against it. **Disjointness rule for the background loop:** the REACH thread OWNS
`profiles/reachability.md` (+ any new REACH wire additions to 18-wire-format/21-errors it introduces) —
spec-perfection fix-agents MUST NOT touch those while REACH is being developed; critique may still READ
them. Recon agent mapping REACH draft + adapter status in flight; profile draft follows.

**REACH spec-first: DONE `e9a8adf` (deep research `wf_4ff01382-713` → decisive Option A).** REACH-2 rewritten:
box↔adapter tunnel = **libp2p-Noise `XX`**, each peer's libp2p identity key = its kotva Ed25519 IK;
signed-static-key payload = SIGMA sign-and-bind, channel-bound by construction (retires the §13 DMTAP-Auth
mis-citation that had produced an Asokan-vulnerable `nonce‖name`-with-no-binding impl). Added REACH-2b
control frames (ReachRegister/ReachRegisterAck, session-local, unsigned); reconciled the adapter descriptor
to §18.8a `CoordinatorDescriptor{kind=reachability-adapter}`; **no new §18 wire object, no new §21 code**;
§7 states Noise secures the control leg ONLY (does not close the REACH-1a cert residual) + IK dual-signing-
domain disclosure. Verified: SIGMA framing correct, no overclaim, lint clean. **Impl (ephor) follows the
freeze** — logged to ephor/COORDINATION.md [2026-07-23 reach] with the 1-day libp2p-noise-0.56 API spike +
atomicity MUST. Round 4 will re-cover REACH under the convergence gate.

**W3 (simplify):** compress per-doc SEC-invariant/honest-residual boilerplate to reference tables
(THREAT-MODEL = single argued source, ~15-20% cut, zero normative loss); turn reproduced index tables into
pointers; publish a minimal "Identity + MOTE + one transport" first-implementation conformance tier.

**W4 (cross-doc consistency):** unified terminology, all cross-refs resolve, family "connection" (SPEC
index + inter-profile links), including the previously-skipped profiles/tract/* + profiles/wrap/*.

**W5 (LAST — editorial):** South African/British English (prose only — NOT the `Authorization` header,
`GatewayAuthz`, wire fields, code, RFC proper nouns) + one RFC-grade skeleton per doc (abstract, BCP-14
conventions, stable numbering, normative/informative references, honest-residual section), modelled on
RFC 9051 / RFC 9420.

**W6 (converge — repeated multi-perspective critique, the hard gate):** critique is NOT a one-shot.
- **After EACH substantive wave commits (W1, W2, W3, W4)**, run a fresh **multi-lens read-only critique**
  over the whole spec (not just the changed files — catch regressions + cross-file contradictions the wave
  introduced). Feed every confirmed residual back as the next fix-wave. Verify each finding adversarially
  (a defect must reproduce; a claimed contradiction must be real) so no false-positive churns the spec.
- **Rotate the perspectives each round** so different angles hit: cryptographer · distributed-systems ·
  IETF-protocol/wire · simplicity/over-engineering · red-team/threat-model · adoption/pragmatist ·
  editorial/RFC-style/spelling · cross-reference-integrity. Every round uses ≥4 lenses; vary the mix
  round to round so the same blind spots aren't re-used.
- **Convergence bar (strict):** declare the spec PERFECTED only after **TWO CONSECUTIVE fully-clean
  multi-lens critique passes run from DIFFERENT lens-sets** — both reporting zero substantive
  contradictions, consistent South-African/British English, RFC-grade layout, and all cross-refs
  resolving. One clean pass is not enough. Then delete this file, stop the cron, report DONE with the
  commit range.
- If a round keeps surfacing the same residual, escalate it (it may be a genuine founder-call → COORDINATION).
  If **three successive convergence rounds** still find substantive residuals, STOP and report to the user.

---

## CURRENT STATUS (supersedes the wave bookkeeping above)

**Defect class.** Nearly every real finding this pass has been one class: **an invariant the prose
states that the mechanism does not enforce.** It is invisible to lint and to casual review; it only
surfaces when a specific mechanism is adversarially traced. Hunt by that heuristic.

**Fixed this pass (all committed + pushed):**
1. §1.4 stolen-`IK` could weaken `RecoveryPolicy` (gate used a generic `satisfies()` an `Ik` disjunct satisfied) — `ad7e79a`
2. §18.9.8 login assertion signed a BARE digest → cross-hash forgery — multihash-prefixed
3. §18.7.3 capability caveats checked only on the LEAF → a child could drop a parent's `require-mfa` — now conjunctive across every chain link, unknown caveat fails closed — `d3eaafe`
4. §22 `FeedEntry.announce` had no author binding → a current-suite feed could launder a below-floor forgery past the origination floor — `5089cd9`
5. §5.2.1(a) last-resort replay defence was an OR whose first branch is vacuous exactly when needed — cache now mandatory — `bbf3004`
6. §2.7 dedup re-acked a COLD duplicate **before** the abuse gate → `ack` became an existence oracle (the doc's own note claimed that ordering prevented it) — `77f0897`
7. §3.5 **KT bootstrap**: the `kt=` log set was read from the very DNS record it was meant to verify, so a zone-controlling attacker supplied key *and* log and satisfied quorum against itself; v1's "pin a set" inherited the flaw. Now: out-of-band log set ⇒ KT-verified; `kt=`-sourced ⇒ **TOFU-only, MUST NOT be shown as KT-verified**. §3.1's detectability claim qualified — `014c9de`
8. Interop: `BlindedTag.shared_secret` was circular + `epoch_day` undefined (pinned: `MLS-Exporter` per §27.5.1, `floor(t_ms/86400000)` UTC, ±1 day); epoch acceptance later **bounded to two epochs** after an unbounded rule was found to fight MLS forward secrecy — `d8eab9f`
9. DEPOT schemas were **named but undefined** → now concrete det-CBOR (no floats; uptime is per-mille `uint`) — `03fab9f`
10. Bloat retired into existing primitives: `ServiceMeasurement`→ATTEST, `TrustEdge`→ATTEST (the latter violated ATTEST's own "MUST NOT invent a parallel attestation object")
11. ATTEST↔REPUTATION issuer contradiction resolved (ATTEST gained a pseudonymous-issuer mode with its disqualification stated); REP-2's primitive-depends-on-profile citation fixed — `d6f7b5a`
12. §10.1 structural-version (DS-tag/`v=dmtap`) migration specified — the hardest-to-change seam — `03f4647`; §10.3a falsifiable Core boundary + the **two senses of "Core"** disambiguated — `06f5f80`, `77f0897`
13. Overclaim sweep, 2nd application: REACH's blurb/§1 claimed the adapter never reads traffic and is "blind by construction" while §7/§8 disclose an undetectable MITM for a **bare vanity** — the default the doc introduces first, and which §3's own table already scoped correctly; the whitepaper called media relays "structurally blind by construction" (dropping both `blind-routing`'s metadata caveat and `sframe_required=true`); rtc.md §6 said "by construction" where its own §275 says "an operator commitment, not structural"; TRACT's overview said "**Lawful by construction**" — the exact framing §11.2a rejects verbatim, over an unresolved GDPR Art 17 conflict — `047829e`

**Audited → CLEAN:** substrate/* + TRACT + WRAP; §26 legacy adapters; §22 PUB; §25 PUBSUB; §5.2.1;
SYNC; §18.8a objects; deterministic CBOR §18.1; §2.7; §3 (post-fix); §18.7.3; §1.4; DEPOT;
§12 operators + §14 scaling (**driver-inline**, not agent-audited — see caveat below).
**Fixed, then clean:** §13 org/admin (rank escalation, `db52634`).
**In flight:** §16 · §17 · §21 (numeric/registry drift); §19 · §20 (systematic pass).
**Still un-audited:** *(none — the audit map is CLOSED as of `2357bcc`)*. §23 CAD · §24 video were
the last two; §23 proved to be an 18-line stub folded into §24.18, so the audit ran against §24.18.
Six defects fixed there: CAD-7's "MUST"/"always" enforced only by a SHOULD-level index flag (resolved
fail-safe — a malformed deprecation MUST still be honoured, since discarding it fails *open* on a
safety signal); `mass_unit` and `endorsed-only` each justified by a mechanism their cited section
never defines; `§8-privacy` a typo for the privacy chapter (retargeted to §6.2, deliberately **not**
§6.3, which is the opt-in research-tier mixnet); and a §23→§24.18 renumber gap in
`conformance/suite.json` that neither audit reached, found only by post-fix sweep.

**Caveat on "inline" entries.** Driver-inline checks target the highest-yield axes (framing,
overclaim, refs) and are NOT equivalent to an independent adversarial mechanism-trace. This mattered
twice: an inline pass declared rounds 4-5 "clean" while a live HIGH sat in §1.4, and a driver fix to
§18.3.2 was itself wrong (unbounded epoch retention fighting MLS forward secrecy) until an agent
caught it. Treat inline-audited surfaces as lower-confidence than agent-audited ones.

**Convergence honesty.** The three-round stop-rule has fired (≈11 rounds, each finding something
real). Do NOT declare PERFECTED on a quiet round alone — the honest options are (a) keep hunting
surface-by-surface, or (b) freeze deliberately **with this audited/un-audited map recorded**.

**The yield has changed character, and that is the real signal.** Findings 1–9 were *mechanism*
defects — exploitable holes and interop breaks in wire rules. Findings 10–13 are *summary* defects:
the mechanism is right and the prose above it overstates what the mechanism proves. Nothing in the
last three rounds required a wire change. That is not proof the mechanism is clean (§23 CAD and §24
remain un-audited), but it does mean the marginal round is now buying **honesty of claims**, not
**security**. W5 (South-African English + RFC layout) stays blocked while the summary layer is still
moving — a copy-edit over text that still overclaims only makes the overclaims read better — but the
gap between "correctness still moving" and "W5 unblocked" is now narrower than at any prior round.

**Round 14 and the W5 gate.** Round 14 found six defects, which naively resets the stop-rule again.
It should not, and the distinction is the whole convergence question: **every one was in a file that
had never been audited.** Findings in never-opened files are the expected yield of opening them; they
say nothing about whether the *audited* surfaces are still moving. The clock that gates W5 runs on
audited surfaces only, and by that clock the last wire-level change was round 9.

W5 (South-African English + RFC layout) therefore unblocks on **one quiet confirming pass over the
high-traffic audited surfaces** (`SPEC.md`, `DIRECTION.md`, `00-overview.md`,
`coordinator/CONTRACT.md`) for the live defect class — summary-drops-hedge. Do not unblock it on
this round's evidence alone: six fixes landed in `24-video-profile.md` and `conformance/*` today, and
a copy-edit pass over text that changed hours ago is exactly the churn W5 is sequenced to avoid.

### W6 ROUND 1 — RESULT

| Lens | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Spelling + RFC layout | **1 substantive residual, fixed** (`f0810a1`). No damage: `labeler`, every `ERR_*`, the CDDL `license`, `tls_serialize` and the RFC 8949 quotation all verified byte-intact. |
| Cross-reference integrity | **CLEAN** (driver-run; agent stalled). See the false-positive table below. |
| Correctness / contradictions | **Zero findings**, on honestly-declared partial coverage. |
| Family coherence | **NOT REACHED** — the agent stalled before this half. Carried to round 2. |

**The residual was self-inflicted.** W5's script excluded capitalised forms of the `authorize`
family wholesale in order to protect the HTTP `Authorization` header. Too blunt: it also skipped
sentence- and heading-initial "Authorize", leaving the doctrine phrase American in
`coordinator/CONTRACT.md`, `primitives/MATCH.md` (×2), `profiles/rtc.md` and `conformance/SUITE.md`
— the very phrase W5 was sequenced as one commit to keep consistent. `conformance/SUITE.md:681`
carried both spellings in a single sentence. Lesson: **a freeze rule scoped by letter-case is a
proxy for the thing you actually want to protect, and proxies over-fire.** The right scope was "the
`Authorization` header and RFC titles", not "anything capitalised".

**Two lens-A reports adjudicated as NON-defects** (verified, not assumed):
- `05-messaging.md:57` lowercase "Commits must be applied…" — *describes MLS's own property*; the
  DMTAP obligation follows as "**REQUIRES**" in the next sentence. Correct per `STYLE.md`.
- WRAP `licence` (key 33) vs the spec's `license` — different concepts, not a naming collision:
  WRAP's is a **professional credential** (`"za:pirb"`), where "licence" is the correct British
  noun; `license` is correct as the SPDX identifier.

**One lens-A finding was itself wrong:** the claim that BCP-14 boilerplate exists "only in §21".
**58 files carry it.** Verified before acting — chasing it would have invented a structural gap.

### W6 — CROSS-REFERENCE AUDIT: CLEAN (driver-run, `b8c9a51`..)

Run by the driver as insurance after the W6 cross-ref agent stalled — and it earned its keep, since
that agent never reported. Result: **all relative file links resolve** (one break found and fixed,
and it was in this plan file, not the spec: a `docs/`-relative link missing `../`). **All section
references resolve.** A naive checker reported 104 unresolved `§` refs; every one was a false
positive of the checker, not a defect. Recorded here because the next person to audit this will
build the same naive checker and see the same 104:

| Apparent break | Why it is actually correct |
|---|---|
| `§4.4.x` (≈390 refs) | Mixnet content moved to `docs/research/mixnet.md` and **kept its numbering**; refs are properly repointed as `[docs/research/mixnet.md §4.4.8](…)`. The W1-ripple was done correctly. |
| `§18.8a.1`–`.3` (42) | Real headings — a letter-infix number (`18.8a.1`) that a `(\d+\.)*\d+[a-z]?` regex cannot index. |
| `§6.1.1`, `§6.1.2`, `§4.4` in `substrate/` | `substrate/SYNC.md` has its **own** internal numbering, as do `profiles/tract/`, `profiles/wrap/` and `conformance/`. A `§N.N` is only resolvable relative to its own document. |
| `§0.5.1` (33) | Defined as a **numbered normative statement inside a blockquote** (`> **Normative (§0.5.1).**`), not a heading. |
| `§22.8.1`–`.8` (17) | `§22.8` is a numbered list; `§22.8.4` is item 4. A legitimate `section.item` convention. |
| `§151.0242`, `§4.5.3.1.3` | **External citations** — Texas Tax Code and RFC 5321 respectively, not KOTVA sections. |

**Lesson for any future checker:** resolve `§N.N` against the *citing document's own* numbering
first, index letter-infix and blockquote-labelled section numbers, and exclude external legal/RFC
citations before reporting anything.

### CRITIQUE-LENS ROTATION (founder directive 2026-07-24: "deep research… critique and criticise and look from different perspectives")

Internal review has hit diminishing returns: the spec is now largely self-consistent, so re-reading it
against itself mostly re-confirms it. The remaining defects are the ones **no internal pass can see**.
Rotate these lenses, one or two per wave, and record the result here. A lens that returns clean is a
result worth recording, not a wasted wave.

| # | Lens | The defect class only this lens can find | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Adopted-standards accuracy** (external, web research) | The spec mis-describes an external standard, or the standard moved under it. KOTVA "binds, doesn't reinvent", so a wrong binding is load-bearing. | **HIT — see L1-F1 below.** Agent stalled; driver verified the highest-stakes item directly against the RFC. |

**L1-F1 (OPEN — apply when `profiles/` is free; a W5 agent holds it now).** REACH's `structural`
assurance rests on an RFC 8657 `accounturi`-bound CAA record, and the spec states the consequence as
absolute: blindness is "*structural*, provable from key placement and account binding" and "the
adapter **cannot** mint a competing cert for a zone it does not write" (`profiles/reachability.md`
REACH-1a and §7 SEC-2). **RFC 8657 §5.2, "Restrictions Ineffective without CA Recognition", says the
opposite of what that assumes:** *"Domains configuring CAA records for a CA MUST NOT assume that the
restrictions implied by the 'accounturi' and 'validationmethods' parameters are effective in the
absence of explicit indication as such from that CA."* `accounturi` is **optional CA behaviour** —
honoured only by the CA named in the `issue`/`issuewild` property, and only if that CA implements it.
Against a CAA-permitted CA that ignores the parameter, an in-path adapter can still obtain a
certificate under its own account, and the assurance silently degrades to exactly the `declared` MITM
residual the spec attributes only to bare vanities.

This is the dominant defect class reached from outside: an invariant the prose states that the
mechanism does not enforce — here because enforcement belongs to a **third party the protocol cannot
bind and the client cannot check**. Note the asymmetry that makes it worth stating: the precondition
is verifiable by the *zone owner* (who chooses the CA) and never by the *connecting client*, so it is
a property of the deployment, not of the protocol — which is what `structural` is supposed to mean.

Fix (apply to REACH-1a, §7 SEC-2, and the §8 residual — fix-and-sweep, all three): state that the
`structural` claim additionally requires the named CA to actually honour RFC 8657, cite §5.2, require
the zone owner to restrict `issue`/`issuewild` to CAs whose `accounturi` enforcement it has
established, and state that absent that the level is `declared`.
| L2 | **Prior art / deployed systems** (Matrix, Nostr, ActivityPub, Signal, DIDComm, IPFS, Farcaster) | A failure these systems already hit in production and documented — metadata leakage, relay economics, moderation collapse, key-loss UX, spam. Ours is a paper design; theirs have scars. | pending |
| L3 | **IETF/RFC-editor lens** | RFC-grade structure: BCP-14 correctness, IANA Considerations completeness, Security Considerations per-section, normative vs informative separation, ambiguity an independent implementer would resolve differently. | pending |
| L4 | **Independent implementer** | Can a competent engineer build an interoperating node from the text alone? Every "obvious" step left unwritten is an interop break waiting to happen. | pending |
| L5 | **Operator / economics** | Can anyone actually run this and survive? The coordinator-funding open problem (§5) is disclosed but never stress-tested against real hosting/bandwidth/abuse costs. | pending |
| L6 | **Privacy & regulatory** | GDPR Art 17 vs immutable published objects (TRACT §11's disclosed hard blocker), data-residency, lawful-intercept pressure on coordinators. | pending |

### W5 SAFETY CONTRACT — read before any spelling sweep

**W5 is UNBLOCKED** as of the clean confirming pass over `SPEC.md` · `DIRECTION.md` ·
`00-overview.md` · `coordinator/CONTRACT.md` (zero findings; RESERVE hedge, mixnet scoping,
`blind-routing`, all six open problems and ~35 cross-ref paths verified).

**W5 is the most dangerous wave in this plan, not the safest.** It looks like cosmetic
find-and-replace; it is editing a document whose nouns are load-bearing wire identifiers. An
unguarded sweep silently breaks the protocol and lint will not catch it. Measured hazards:

- **`labeler` is a coordinator KIND NAME** (54 occurrences). SA/British English wants "labeller".
  Renaming it changes a wire identifier. **FROZEN.**
- **`authorization` (99) appears inside REGISTERED ERROR NAMES** — `ERR_DEVICE_UNAUTHORIZED`,
  `ERR_KEYROTATION_UNAUTHORIZED`, `ERR_GATEWAY_SENDER_ADDRESS_UNAUTHORIZED` (§21 registry).
  **FROZEN** in every identifier; prose "authorisation" only.
- **`license` (60) is a CDDL field name** (`ArtifactMetadata` key 9 / key 7) and an SPDX term.
  **FROZEN** as an identifier. In prose the noun is "licence", the verb stays "license".
- **`serialization` (15) appears inside a direct RFC 8949 quotation** ("preferred serialization")
  and in `tls_serialize`. **A quotation MUST NOT be re-spelled** — altering quoted standards text
  is a correctness defect, not a style choice.

**FROZEN — never re-spell, even in prose:** the twelve coordinator kinds (`gateway`, `relay`,
`media-relay`, `reachability-adapter`, `infra-service`, `indexer`, `labeler`, `matcher`, `compute`,
`arbiter`, `oracle`, `custodial-escrow`); the visibility/assurance vocabulary (`blind`,
`blind-routing`, `terminating`, `structural`, `attested`, `declared`); every `ERR_*` name; every
CDDL field name and map key; capability tokens (`pub-1`, `vid-live-1`, …); DS-tags, suite ids,
`det_cbor`, `tls_serialize`; HTTP header names; SPDX identifiers; anything inside backticks, code
fences, JSON/CDDL, URLs, file paths or link targets; **quoted text from any RFC or standard**; and
product/proper nouns.

**CHANGE (prose only, outside backticks):** behaviour→behaviour, defence→defence, offence→offence,
centre→centre, catalogue→catalogue, labelled→labelled, labelling→labelling, enrolment→enrolment,
organisation→organisation, recognise→recognise, normalise→normalise, analyse→analyse,
meter→metre (only where it is the unit). **KEEP:** `program` (computing sense), `practice` (the
noun is identical in British English; only the verb is "practise").

**W5 IS ALL-OR-NOTHING ACROSS FILE SETS, NOT PER-FILE.** The doctrine phrase **"authorise, never
classify"** appears in 13 files spanning *every* file set — `SPEC.md`, `DIRECTION.md`,
`THREAT-MODEL.md`, `coordinator/CONTRACT.md`, `conformance/SUITE.md`, three `primitives/`, four
`profiles/`, `docs/research/PRIMITIVES.md` — and it is the family's most-quoted line. Converting it in
one file set and not the others leaves the spec saying "authorise, never classify" in `profiles/`
and "authorise, never classify" in `DIRECTION.md`, which is precisely the inconsistency W6 checks
for. **Either every occurrence converts in the same wave, or none does.** The same holds for any
phrase repeated verbatim across documents.

`conformance/scope.json` carries section *titles* as literal strings (e.g. "7.11.4 The gateway
authorises; it never classifies (normative)"). **Tested: these are NOT lint-coupled** — `scope.json`
is keyed by section number, and re-spelling a title leaves lint at 0 errors. So a heading change
cannot break the build, but scope.json titles must still be swept for consistency, since they are
copies of headings a reader will compare.

**W5 STATUS: DONE (automated + manual).** Automated pass — `6dcd626`, 1385 substitutions across 83 tracked files in one
commit (all-or-nothing, per the rule above). Verified after applying: `labeler` untouched at 56
occurrences with zero "labeller"; no `ERR_*` name altered; no British spelling inside any code span
or fence; the RFC 8949 "preferred serialization" quotation byte-identical; `tls_serialize` intact.

**W5 REMAINDER — DONE (`1459538`).** `signaling`→`signalling` (70, including the substrate role label
and heading, moved together because a role name carries the same all-or-nothing constraint as the
doctrine phrase) and prose `serialization`→`serialisation` (12). **Three of the six excluded words
needed no change at all, which checking established and assuming would not have:** `meter` is always
the verb or a substring of "parameter" (British English reserves "metre" for the unit); `practice`
has zero verb uses and the noun is identical; `program` is the computing sense throughout. `license`
was already "licence" in every prose-noun position. Original table kept below for the record:

| Word | Count | Why it needs a human |
|---|---:|---|
| `signaling` | 70 | **Signalling** is a substrate *role name* (`substrate/ROLES.md` §3). Prose → "signalling"; the role label must move consistently everywhere or not at all — same all-or-nothing rule as the doctrine phrase. |
| `license` | 62 | CDDL field key and SPDX term (frozen); prose noun → "licence"; prose verb stays "license". Needs per-occurrence judgement. |
| `practice` | 18 | The noun is identical in British English. Only a *verb* use becomes "practise". Most hits are correct already. |
| `serialization` | 17 | Inside an RFC 8949 quotation and in `tls_serialize` (both frozen); other prose uses → "serialisation". |
| `meter` | 9 | "metre" only where it is the unit of length; `parameter`-adjacent and code uses stay. |
| `program` | 7 | Correct as-is in the computing sense. Likely a no-op; verify, don't change reflexively. |

**Script scope:** the W5 script walked every `*.md` on disk and edited 87 files under gitignored
`build/node_modules/` (repo unaffected; restored with `npm ci`). A repo-wide text sweep MUST be
scoped to `git ls-files`, not `rglob`.

**Sequencing:** run the prose-dense, identifier-light files first (`profiles/`, `primitives/`) to
validate the method, and only then the numbered core files (`00`–`27`), which are the most
identifier-dense and where a bad replace is most costly. After every W5 commit, diff-review for
identifier drift — `git diff` and grep the frozen list — because lint cannot see this class of
break.

### Method notes earned the hard way (keep these)

**1. Fix-and-sweep, never fix-in-place.** An agent report names *where a defect was found*, not
every place it occurs. Three times a fix was applied only at the reported site and the same defect
survived elsewhere: the group rank rule (fixed §19.5.2, missed §5.8.2 — *the authority §19.5.2
cites*); the `fast/onion` bulk mislabel (fixed 2 lines in §2.5, missed 6 more, one of them two lines
below); the RESERVE honesty qualifier (fixed `SPEC.md`, missed `DIRECTION.md`, `primitives/OFFER.md`,
`docs/research/PRIMITIVES.md`). **After every fix, grep the whole tree for echoes of the same claim
before committing.**

**2. Summaries drop hedges the detail carries.** A doc can be scrupulously honest in its depths and
overclaiming at its surface — and the surface is what gets read and quoted. `primitives/RESERVE.md`
scoped its guarantee correctly and disclosed the malicious-owner case in §9; four separate summaries
of it asserted the absolute. Audit index/overview docs *against* the sections they summarise.

**3. Prose that argues for its own correctness is a red flag.** The dedup ack-oracle was found
because a note explained *why* its ordering prevented an oracle — while the ordering did not. Text
that justifies an invariant is worth checking against the mechanism precisely because it sounds
settled.

**4. Lint-guard every commit.** `lint && git commit` piped through `tail` cannot fail; one broken
commit reached `main` that way. Use an explicit `grep -q "^0 error"` guard.

**5. An in-text "TODO"/"owed to §X" is a defect, not documentation.** §20's replay-cache row had
flagged its own unresolved conflict; it sat there until treated as a finding.

**6. An agent's "clean" is scoped to what it read, not to the file.** A sweep reported `profiles/rtc.md`
clean, having checked §4/§7/§8 where every blindness claim *is* correctly conditioned — and missed
the same overclaim in §6's scaling paragraph, outside its window. Agents report their method
honestly; read it, and check the surfaces it names as skipped. A file is only as audited as the
sections actually opened.

**8. A verification command that errors prints nothing — and nothing reads as clean.** Checking
whether the W5 script had touched vendored files, `find … -newermt "-30 minutes"` failed on this
platform (BSD `find` rejects the relative timestamp), printed only to stderr, and produced an empty
result that was reported as "vendored untouched". It had in fact edited 87 files. This is the same
failure as the `lint | tail` commit guard: **an empty result is only evidence when the command is
known to have run.** Make verification commands prove they executed — check the exit status, or
assert on a positive control that must produce output.

**7. Verify before fixing, including in the "obvious" direction.** The same sweep implied
`rtc.md`'s other `content-blind` uses were suspect. They are correct: `blind-routing` means
precisely *blind to content, routing visible*. Fixing them would have introduced an error while
"correcting" one. Fix-and-sweep widens the candidate set; it does not license editing every hit.
