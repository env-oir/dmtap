The one rule governs all six ([DIRECTION §0](../../DIRECTION.md)): **the primitive works offline
against local trust; a coordinator only adds reach and never gates function.** Each primitive below
is stated at both anchors of the scale-invariance slider ([DIRECTION §6](../../DIRECTION.md)).

## 0. The map at a glance

| Primitive | Bind to (DIRECTION §3) | Substrate carrier | Coordinator kind (if any) | Content-visibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OFFER** | content-addressed signed listing (no registry) | Feeds & Blobs / DMTAP-PUB (§22) | `indexer` (discovery only) | listing public by design; indexer `blind`/attested |
| **MATCH** | order-book / auction assignment (no standard to bind — it is a coordinator) | two OFFERs in, signed Assignment out | `matcher` | sees offers → `terminating`; TEE-`attested` preferred |
| **RESERVE** | single-owner bounded-counter CRDT | SYNC single-writer object (§5.6, TRACT §6) | **none** (self-serving by construction) | owner-held; no intermediary |
| **REPUTATION** | OpenRank (EigenTrust, TEE) over the attestation graph — **no global score** | Review / attestation feed objects (§22) | `indexer` (derived, rebuildable) | public objects; index `blind`/attested |
| **ATTEST** | EAS + W3C Verifiable Credentials; personhood → World ID / Human Passport | signed feed object (§22) or sealed `identity` MOTE (kind 0x09) | `oracle` (only for physical-fact attestation) | issuer-signed, public or sealed |
| **ESCROW** | HTLC / smart-contract escrow on a stablecoin rail; dispute → Kleros-class | EscrowScope (public) + PaymentAttestation (sealed) + escrow state machine | `arbiter` / escrow operator | evidence `terminating`, disclosed |

Two invariants cut across the whole table: **the protocol carries attestations, never funds**
([TRACT §9.2](../../profiles/tract/09-settlement.md)), and **no object carries a network-wide
published score or a protocol token** ([DIRECTION §5](../../DIRECTION.md),
[CONTRACT §2.1](../../coordinator/CONTRACT.md)).

---

## 1. OFFER — a signed listing, not a registry

- **Bind to:** the substrate's own **content-addressed signed public object** (Feeds & Blobs /
  DMTAP-PUB, §22). There is no external "listing standard" worth importing; the correct move is
  *don't reinvent a registry* — an OFFER is a `PubAnnounce`/`FeedEntry` on the author's feed. TRACT
  (`Offer`, §16.5.2) and WRAP (`Offer`) are the two worked profiles.
- **Wire shape:** an OFFER rides the author feed as a signed public object addressed by
  `(author IK, content-address)`. TRACT structures its body along four axes (catalogue /
  availability / consideration / fulfilment); WRAP carries `mode` + `pool` + terms. Sealed variants
  (a private quote to one buyer) ride a normal MOTE (`mail`/`chat`, §2.3) instead of a public feed.
- **Normative rules a binding MUST carry:**
  - The subject/identifier MUST be **operator-independent** — the author `IK` and the offer's
    content-address, identical at every index and gateway (so reputation and history follow the
    key, not a storefront; TRACT §10.2b).
  - **Withdrawal is supersession, never deletion** — a later signed feed entry supersedes; a
    byte-holder that kept the old bytes is not violating anything (§22.6, TRACT §10.2d).
  - An OFFER's availability is a **signal, not a hold** — reading it as a reservation is a category
    error; the hold lives in RESERVE (TRACT §3.9).
  - **No canonical catalog.** Indexes over public offers are *derived, rebuildable, and never
    authoritative* (§22.4.3); different indexes reaching different sets is the design.
- **Small scale / offline:** an offer sent point-to-point (`mode = direct`, WRAP §8.2) needs no
  infrastructure at all and covers most real relationships. **Global:** an `indexer` coordinator
  makes offers discoverable.
- **Honest ceiling:** *there is no open discovery without infrastructure* (WRAP §8.1) — global reach
  requires an indexer, which can re-rank/omit (fenced by swappability + "authorize, never classify",
  CONTRACT §4). Freshness is bounded only by feed-poll cadence (TRACT §3.8). Listing spam/Sybil is
  unsolved at the protocol layer and is index-local policy.

## 2. MATCH — the one engine, differing only in the assignment rule

- **Bind to:** nothing standardized cleanly maps (order books and auction engines are venue-internal),
  so MATCH is a **`matcher` coordinator** under the contract, not a new primitive. Its only variation
  across services is the **assignment rule** — nearest (rides), highest-bid (auctions), best-fit
  (freelance) — which is *matcher policy*, not protocol (DIRECTION §2, §6). Prefer a **TEE-`attested`**
  matcher so a global view is possible without an operator reading plaintext (bindings: TEEs).
- **Wire shape:** two OFFERs in — a demand OFFER and supply OFFERs (or bids: WRAP `Bid`) — and one
  **signed Assignment out** (WRAP `Assignment`), authored by the matcher and delivered to the
  matched parties as a MOTE. The matcher holds only rebuildable operational state.
- **Normative rules:**
  - The matcher **authorizes, never classifies** (CONTRACT §4): it checks *who and rate*, never
    *whether content is wanted*.
  - **Swappable + self-hostable** — the local fallback is a *dumb local order book* the parties run
    themselves; the assignment rule and the party set MUST survive dropping the matcher (CONTRACT
    §2.2–2.3, DIRECTION §6).
  - The matcher **cannot forge a match**: every OFFER/Bid/Assignment is author-signed; it distributes
    and proposes, it does not produce signatures it lacks (WRAP §8.3).
- **Content-visibility:** a matcher **reads the offers by definition** — this is the one role that is
  *not* content-blind unless run in a TEE (WRAP §8.5). It MUST declare `terminating` (or `attested`
  if TEE), and clients MUST surface that (CONTRACT §3). Mitigations: coarse offers (area/window/range)
  with exact detail only in the sealed Assignment.
- **Honest ceiling:** global-view optimization is exactly where centralization regrows; the contract
  confines but does not remove it. Blind matching needs a TEE (chip-vendor trust, side-channel
  history — `attested`, never trustless, bindings note). Offline, MATCH degrades to a local order
  book with no global optimality.

## 3. RESERVE — single owner, so double-booking is structurally impossible

- **Bind to:** a **single-writer bounded-counter CRDT** — the host's box is the *only* writer for its
  own calendar/inventory, so concurrent overselling is impossible by construction (DIRECTION §2). This
  is the substrate's §5.6 device-cluster CRDT / SYNC single-owner profile, realized as TRACT's
  bounded-counter inventory (§6) grounded in AntidoteDB `antidote_crdt_counter_b` (SRDS 2015). **No
  coordinator, ever** — RESERVE is the primitive that needs none.
- **Wire shape:** a SYNC object in the owner's namespace whose value is a bounded counter, mutated by
  owner-signed ops; or TRACT §6's counter beneath a published `Availability` band. A booking is the
  owner's authoritative `placed → accepted / declined` step (TRACT §3.9, §18.3), not a client-side read.
- **Normative rules:**
  - **Exactly one writer per resource.** A reservation against a single-owner calendar MUST resolve
    on the owner's node; a buyer's local availability read MUST NOT be represented as a hold (TRACT
    §3.7, §3.9).
  - The guarantee is **safety-only, paid entirely in liveness** — stranded quota and spurious
    "sold out" are the cost of never overselling from stale state (TRACT §3.9 honest limit).
- **Honest ceiling:** the no-oversell invariant is **non-Byzantine** — it protects a seller from
  their *own* concurrency, not a buyer from a *dishonest* seller (TRACT §21.10.2). RESERVE guarantees
  no oversell, not honest supply; the availability *signal* upstream of it guarantees even less.

## 4. REPUTATION — locally measured or OpenRank-computed, never a published number

- **Bind to:** **OpenRank** (EigenTrust, TEE-verified) as *compute* over the public attestation/review
  graph — and, at small scale, direct web-of-trust (DIRECTION §6). Bind the *algorithm as a service*,
  never a score we mint (bindings: Reputation).
- **Wire shape:** the graph is ordinary public feed data — TRACT `Review` objects (§10.2), ATTEST
  claims (§5 below), WRAP work attestations — all addressed by the **stable subject identifier**
  (product content-address or subject `IK`). Reputation is *derived* by an `indexer` (or computed
  locally) from these feeds; it is never an object on the wire.
- **Normative rules:**
  - **No network-wide published score, and no object carries one** (TRACT §10.3); a coordinator's
    descriptor explicitly carries no global reputation number (CONTRACT §2.1). Reputation is
    *locally measured by each client from its own results* (CONTRACT §2.1) or bound to OpenRank —
    never one authority's number.
  - Reputation is **portable and un-suppressible**: it attaches to the key, any node MAY gather and
    index the feeds without permission, and a subject cannot delete an unfavourable review by leaving
    a platform (there is none) (TRACT §10.2b).
  - Review authorship uses **per-subject pseudonymous subkeys** (not the root `IK`), so subjects
    cannot join a buyer's reviews across them (TRACT §10.2); retraction is supersede, cooperative-only
    (§10.2d).
  - Different indexes reaching different rankings is **the design, not a defect** (TRACT §10.3).
- **Honest ceiling:** the achievable **Sybil-cost floor on a signed-feed substrate is an open
  question** (TRACT §21.8). Attestation-gating (§5) raises manipulation cost but **self-dealing
  produces genuine attestations** and **whitewashing is bounded only by discounting new keys** — a
  purely index-local defence, since no authority may ban (TRACT §10.3a, §10.4). Global reputation
  quality is capped by the personhood anchor, which is imperfect (bindings: Proof-of-personhood).

## 5. ATTEST — a signed claim; the issuer's standing is the whole trust

- **Bind to:** **EAS** (Ethereum Attestation Service) and **W3C Verifiable Credentials** for the
  claim shape; **World ID / Human Passport** for the specific personhood claim that anchors anti-Sybil
  (DIRECTION §3, bindings). Do not invent a credential format.
- **Wire shape:** an attestation is a signed object carrying `{issuer IK, subject, schema/type, claim,
  ts, ?revocation-ref}` — either a **public** feed object (§22) when the claim is meant to be openly
  verifiable, or a **sealed `identity` MOTE** (kind `0x09`, §2.3) when it is a private identity claim.
  Profile-specific attestations already exist: TRACT `PurchaseAttestation` (§10.2a) and WRAP work
  attestations both follow this shape, addressing their subject by content-address or `IK` only.
- **Normative rules:**
  - An attestation is **verifiable offline by the issuer's signature** — it proves *`IK` said this*,
    and *nothing more*. A client MUST NOT present an attestation as an established fact beyond the
    issuer's standing (cf. TRACT §10.2a "what attestation does not establish").
  - **Revocation is supersession / status-list**, honoured cooperatively (as with reviews, TRACT
    §10.2d); an attestation MUST reference the subject by a stable operator-independent id.
  - For a **physical-fact** attestation (delivered? ride done?) the issuer is an **`oracle`
    coordinator** — accountable, swappable, `terminating`, disclosed (CONTRACT §5).
- **Honest ceiling:** the **physical-event oracle** ceiling (DIRECTION §8.2) — an oracle can attest
  *origin-through-itself* but can never prove *non-fabrication*; "did it happen?" reduces to
  dual-confirm + dispute. Issuer trust is exogenous (an attestation is only as good as the issuer),
  and **personhood is imperfect** — every method trades off (biometric+operator, or passport-zk
  excludes the undocumented). Local scale substitutes web-of-trust.

## 6. ESCROW — attestations on the wire, funds on the rail, disputes to a staked jury

- **Bind to:** **HTLC / smart-contract escrow** on an existing **stablecoin** settlement rail for the
  non-custodial case; a **licensed escrow operator** (TRACT §9 operator class) for the custodial case;
  **Kleros-class staked juries** for dispute (bindings: Payments, Dispute). Stake and settlement are
  in *existing* assets — **no protocol token** (DIRECTION §5).
- **Wire shape:** three parts — `EscrowScope` (public, the operator's declared lawful cover, TRACT
  §16.5.4), `PaymentAttestation` (sealed, *attests* a settlement, never moves it, §16.6), and the
  escrow **state machine** `fund → hold → release / refund / split` (TRACT §18.5). The signed
  per-transition object and the signed ruling are a **known §16 gap** (TRACT §9.4.3, marked
  PROVISIONAL) — a binding that needs them adds an escrow-transition object carrying the operator
  signature, from/to state, order address, and evidence ref.
- **Normative rules:**
  - **The protocol carries attestations, never funds** (TRACT §9.2, §9.4.1) — no PAN, no account
    data, no credential; KOTVA custodies and converts nothing and takes no cut (CONTRACT §6).
  - **`RailClass` is part of the type** (`CustodialReversible` vs `NonCustodialFinal`) because it
    changes the buyer's recourse; substituting one for the other without fresh explicit agreement MUST
    be rejected (TRACT §9.3).
  - **Fail-closed scope intersection** at checkout: a missing/unparseable/incomparable `EscrowScope`
    field means *not covered*, not covered; an empty intersection MUST surface explicitly and MUST NOT
    silently downgrade to an unescrowed trade (TRACT §9.4.2).
  - The escrow operator is **permissionless, per-order, competing, replaceable, and never holds
    identity keys** (TRACT §9.5); an unescrowed trade MUST be a disclosed outcome, never a silent
    default (§9.5a). Where a coordinator stakes (arbiter/oracle), the stake is an existing asset sized
    to value-at-risk (DIRECTION §5).
- **Honest ceiling:** **non-custodial programmatic escrow deadlocks on genuine disputes** — multisig /
  hashlock+timelock removes the custodian but has *no move* when neither party acts; the only honest
  options are a timeout defaulting to one party (a policy choice, not neutral) or an indefinite lock
  (TRACT §9.6). **Opt-in escrow is declined by exactly the actors it targets** (OpenBazaar's measured
  outcome, TRACT §9.5a). The **escrow operator is structurally permanent** — holding money for
  strangers is licensed and does not decay (TRACT §9.6, §0.4.3). **Physical custody cannot be made
  trustless** (escrow moves money, not goods).

## 7. Honest residual

- **Every primitive keeps its coordinator non-load-bearing except one, and it says so.** OFFER,
  REPUTATION, MATCH, ATTEST degrade to local-trust versions offline (web-of-trust, local order book,
  direct offers) and *still function* (DIRECTION §6). RESERVE needs no coordinator by construction.
  ESCROW is the honest exception: **its operator is structurally permanent** (licensed money-holding
  does not self-extinguish), and the design keeps only the weaker guarantee that the class is one,
  permissionless, competing, per-order, replaceable, and never key-holding (TRACT §9.6).
- **The four root ceilings (DIRECTION §8) account for every residual above, and no seam closes them:**
  global anti-Sybil (caps REPUTATION and offer-spam), the physical-event oracle (caps ATTEST and the
  ESCROW dispute), the legal/authoritative-issuer burden (the ESCROW operator absorbs it for pay — the
  burden moves, it does not vanish), and editorial governance (which OFFER/REPUTATION indexes decline
  to centralize, at the cost of one authoritative answer).
- **What is genuinely future-proofed vs. genuinely fundamental.** *Technical* gaps converge on
  centralized quality as the frontier improves — a better personhood method is a REPUTATION binding
  swap, a TEE matcher is a MATCH coordinator swap, a TEE index is an OFFER/REPUTATION indexer swap —
  with no rearchitecture (research/README §4). The *structural* residuals (opt-in escrow declined,
  self-dealing attestations, Sybil-cost floor, non-custodial dispute deadlock) are consequences of not
  being a single surveilling company, and several are the point — disclosed, not solved.
- **Trust/dispute research returned nothing verified** across the grounding passes (TRACT §21.1). The
  reasoning here is checked for internal consistency against the anchor specs; it MUST NOT be read as
  evidenced, and the maturity/demand claims in [`bindings/README.md`](../../bindings/README.md) are a
  2026-07 snapshot to be re-checked before any binding is relied on in production.
