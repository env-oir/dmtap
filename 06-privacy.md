# 6. Privacy & Threat Model

DMTAP protects **content, authenticity, and metadata**. This section states the threat model
honestly, defines the guarantees, and marks the boundaries we do *not* claim.

## 6.1 Adversary model

| Adversary | Capability | DMTAP posture |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Network eavesdropper (local) | reads links near a node | defeated (encryption + onion) |
| Malicious relay / mix node | sees ciphertext it forwards | defeated (content-blind, no single hop links ends) |
| Curious directory / DNS / KT log | sees lookups | mitigated (mixnet-routed lookups §3.7); binding tamper-evident (KT §3.5) |
| **Global passive adversary** | observes all links, all timing | **primary target**: social graph + timing hidden by mixnet + cover traffic |
| Global *active* adversary (inject/drop/delay at will, unlimited resources) | shapes traffic to correlate | **not fully defeated** — see §6.6 |
| Compromised endpoint (node seized/keylogged) | reads that node's plaintext | **hardened, then bounded** (§6.6 item 3): hardware-backed non-exportable keys (§1.2a), device-unlock-gated at-rest encryption (§6.7), per-device sealing, and fast revocation heal all cases **except** a device *actively compromised while unlocked and in use* |

DMTAP's headline guarantee is **strong metadata privacy against a global *passive* adversary.**

## 6.2 What is protected, and how

- **Content** — MLS/HPKE end-to-end encryption (§2, §5). Only recipients decrypt.
- **Authenticity** — signed payloads; identity bound to name via KT (§1, §3).
- **Sender identity** — **sealed sender**: the sender's identity and authenticating signature
  live *inside* the encrypted payload; intermediaries see only ciphertext to an opaque
  destination (§2.2). Honest scope: sealed sender hides the sender from *intermediaries*, but
  **does not hide the sender's IP** (the mixnet does that) and is a metadata-*reduction*, not
  elimination — receipt/timing side channels can statistically erode it (Martiny et al.,
  NDSS 2021), which is why cover traffic (§6.3) and mixing are load-bearing, not optional.
- **Recipient identity** — the mixnet delivers by **push to an always-on node** whose network
  identity is decoupled from the human identity; this removes the store-and-poll step PIR
  exists to protect (§6.4).
- **Social graph & timing** — **mixnet** (onion routing + Poisson mixing delays) so no node
  sees both ends and timing correlation is defeated; plus **cover traffic** and **size
  padding** (§6.3).
- **Discovery** — name→key lookups routed through the mixnet, hiding *who* looks up *whom*
  (§3.7).

## 6.3 Mixnet, cover traffic, padding

- **Onion packets** (Sphinx-format, constant length) traverse a path of mix nodes; each peels
  one layer.
- **Mixing delay** — each mix holds packets a randomized (Poisson) time and reorders, so input
  and output streams cannot be timing-correlated.
- **Cover traffic** — nodes emit loop and drop cover messages at a steady rate; an observer
  cannot distinguish real activity from cover. Rate is a **tunable knob** (higher rate → more
  privacy, more bandwidth).
- **Size padding** — MOTEs are padded to fixed size buckets so the *exact* length does not leak
  (an observer learns only which of the **two** size buckets, §4.4.1 — at most one bit per message).

These are **normative and fully specified** — the Sphinx packet format, mix directory, path
selection, key rotation, cover-traffic rates, active-attack detection, entry guards, operator
diversity, fail-closed no-downgrade, and the high-security profile — in **§4.4.1–§4.4.10** with
parameters in **§16.3**; this subsection is the summary, §4.4 is the buildable specification.

Email's asynchrony is the enabling property: minutes of latency are acceptable for the
`private` tier, and higher latency yields stronger anonymity.

## 6.4 Push delivery vs. PIR — what this design choice actually buys, and what it does not

PIR (Pung, Talek) exists to hide **which record a client reads from an untrusted shared
mailbox that holds everyone's mail** — a leak that only exists *because* those systems use a
polled central store to support offline recipients. DMTAP makes a different **design choice**
for the case it can: **an always-on recipient node receives by push** through the mixnet, so
for *that* node there is no untrusted shared store being queried and thus no read-access-pattern
to hide for its live traffic. This is a genuine architectural difference for the always-on case,
not a trick. (Note: Loopix itself *does* use provider store-and-poll to serve offline clients;
DMTAP's always-on-push is a deliberate divergence, not an inherent property of mixnets.)

**This is not the whole picture, and an earlier revision of this section let it read as though it
were.** Push-through-the-mixnet is only a description of what happens while a recipient node is
actually online and receiving. A recipient that is not always reachable — a phone, a laptop,
anything that sleeps, closes, or loses connectivity, which is the **common** case, not the
exception — is served instead by the buffer role (§14.5): a peer or relay holds sealed
ciphertext, and the recipient's device **polls it on return**. A polled shared store that a
third party can observe is *exactly* the untrusted-store-access-pattern problem PIR was built to
solve, restated for a mailbox instead of a database. DMTAP does not make that problem disappear
by choosing push for the online case; it simply does not arise **for that traffic**. The
buffered/offline case is a separate, disclosed exposure, stated honestly at §6.6 item 17 rather
than folded into this section's "no untrusted shared store" claim, which held only for the
always-on path this paragraph actually describes.

**But push delivery is not "recipient anonymity, solved."** Three residual exposures remain.
The requirements in items 1–2 below are **normative and owned here** (this clause, not the
honest-limits prose of §6.6, is their home; §6.6 and §6.9 point back to it):

1. **Last-hop / receipt visibility.** The final mix and a global observer of the recipient's
   link learn that *a packet was delivered to node X*. An always-on node has a **stable,
   targetable network presence** — itself a fingerprint. The node's network identity MUST be
   cryptographically and durably **decoupled** from the human identity (pseudonymous peer id,
   no re-identifying metadata).
2. **Receipt-timing.** Without cover on the delivery link, observing the node reveals *when*
   messages arrive. The recipient node MUST receive a steady **Poisson cover stream** so real
   receipts are indistinguishable from cover (as Loopix does with loop + link cover).
3. **Long-term intersection / statistical-disclosure attacks.** Persistent presence is
   exposed to correlation across many rounds; cover traffic bounds but does not eliminate this
   (cf. Vuvuzela's differential-privacy noise, which degrades over volume). This is inherited,
   not solved; the bounding mechanisms (entry guards, operator diversity, cover rates) are
   normative in §4.4.5 and §4.4.8.

**Offline buffering — the honest state, not the comfortable one.** If a node is down, a peer/relay
holds sealed ciphertext (§14.5) for later pickup. **A prior revision of this paragraph described
that pickup as happening "via an unlinkable dead-drop token over the mixnet."** That phrase
appeared nowhere else in this specification — no object, no derivation, no verifier, no state
machine — and made a stronger claim than anything actually specified. It is removed. What is
actually specified is a **polled, content-blind shared buffer** (§14.5): the recipient's device
retrieves by its per-recipient delivery tag when it returns online, and the buffer holder (or
anyone observing it) sees that tag polled, at that time, moving that much ciphertext. §6.6 item 17
states this residual in full; DMTAP neither runs PIR against the buffer nor specifies a blinded
retrieval ceremony that would remove it — this is the priced-in cost of not paying for either.

## 6.5 Privacy tiers (and where each product sits)

| Tier | Path | Latency | Graph privacy | Default for |
|------|------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| `private` | full mixnet + cover | minutes | strong (global passive) — quantified, see §6.4/§4.4.11 | mail, all control MOTEs, **normal-size files** |
| `fast` | direct / few-hop | sub-second | content only | live chat (both online), **large-file bulk** |

- Default is `private`. `fast` is opt-in. Because *choosing* `fast` is itself a signal, clients
  keep `private` as the standing default and cover it with cover traffic.
- **Files:** the control MOTE is always `private`. **Normal-size files route through the
  mixnet like messages (same private-tier metadata privacy as messages — strong vs a global
  passive adversary; the §6.6 residuals apply).** **Large-file bulk** uses `fast` — but MUST
  be **onion-routed (a few hops, Tor-style) + size-padded to buckets + swarmed from multiple
  holders**, accepting bandwidth cost. **This bulk tier is explicitly weaker:** like Tor, it
  provides relationship anonymity against *local/partial* adversaries but is **vulnerable to
  end-to-end traffic correlation** by an adversary observing both endpoints (Murdoch–Danezis,
  2005). Swarming and padding raise cost; they do not guarantee anonymity. The strong
  guarantee is the *messaging* tier; moving large sensitive files inherits Tor's correlation
  exposure. See §5.5, §4.5.

## 6.6 Honest boundaries (what we do NOT claim)

1. **Global active adversary — the irreducible residual *after* the mechanisms.** DMTAP does not
   treat the active adversary as an unaddressed limit: §4.4.6–§4.4.10 specify concrete, normative
   defenses — **per-epoch mix replay caches** (drop replayed packets), **tagging-resistant
   integrity-protected Sphinx headers**, **memoryless Poisson mixing** (timing correlation stays
   hard even under active delay injection), **loop-cover active-attack detection** that turns
   drop/delay/flooding from undetectable into **detected → rotate + `HALT_ALERT` + fail-closed**,
   **entry guards + `≥ 3`-disjoint-operator path diversity** bounding long-term intersection,
   **attested (non-token) mix identities** for Sybil resistance, and a **no-silent-downgrade
   rule** (§4.4.9) so DoSing the mixnet cannot strip the tier. A **user-selectable high-security
   profile** (§4.4.10 — 5 hops, longer delays, constant-rate cover, tighter guards/diversity) is
   the lever to climb toward the bound.
   **After all of that**, an irreducible residual remains: by the **Anonymity Trilemma** (Das,
   Meiser, Mohammadi & Kate, *"Anonymity Trilemma: Strong Anonymity, Low Bandwidth Overhead, Low
   Latency — Choose Two,"* IEEE S&P 2018), strong anonymity provably **cannot** be had without
   paying in latency and/or bandwidth, so a global *active* adversary with unlimited resources that
   controls a large enough fraction of the network can still mount long-term statistical disclosure
   at *some* latency/cost point. DMTAP **approaches** that mathematical floor as the high-security
   profile's latency/overhead grows; it does **not** pretend to defeat an omnipotent adversary at
   zero cost. This is the honest floor *after* the maximal defense, not a substitute for it.
   One concrete edge of that residual: **sub-threshold selective dropping** — an adversary dropping
   fewer than the loop-loss detection threshold (< 20%, §16.3) of a target's packets — stays under
   the §4.4.7 detector, so it is **bounded, not eliminated**; the trade is that so little is dropped
   it accomplishes little, and the **High-security profile** (faster loops, §4.4.10) tightens the
   detectable floor further.
   One claim is prohibited outright (normative, owned here): an implementation or operator MUST
   NOT claim that raising hop count alone defends against colluding entry+exit mixes. Hops buy
   timing-correlation resistance against *observers*; entry guards + attested operator diversity
   bound *endpoint collusion* (≈ *f*², §4.4.8, §4.4.10) — and neither substitutes for the other.
   The measured basis is reported informatively in §6.10.
2. **Large-file bulk metadata.** Onion-routing + padding + swarming makes it *strong*, not
   *free* and not *perfect* — the fact and approximate volume of a large transfer may remain
   partially observable at high adversary capability.
3. **Endpoint compromise — the irreducible residual *after* the mechanisms.** DMTAP does not
   treat endpoint compromise as an unaddressed limit; it specifies concrete, normative defenses
   that shrink the blast radius to a single floor:
   - **Offline seizure is defended.** The local MOTE store is encrypted with a key **released
     only on device unlock** (biometric/PIN, §6.7), so a powered-off / locked stolen phone yields
     **nothing** — the ciphertext is inert without the unlock secret.
   - **Key exfiltration is defended.** `IK`/device keys **MUST** live in a hardware keystore as
     **non-exportable** keys where the platform provides one (Secure Enclave / TPM / StrongBox /
     TEE, §1.2a), and SHOULD use the strongest available key-protection class otherwise, so even
     a software compromise cannot *copy* the key out to sign or decrypt elsewhere — it can only
     *use* it locally while the device is unlocked, and only until revoked.
   - **Single-device compromise heals.** A device is its own MLS leaf (§5.6); removing/rotating it
     (§1.5, §13.4) advances every epoch (**post-compromise security**) so the evicted key decrypts
     nothing further, and the **lost/stolen-device flow** (§6.7) evicts it from the cluster. One
     compromised device does **not** hand over other devices' independent sessions.
   - **Least-persistence options.** OPTIONAL **scoped sync** (recent-N-days on mobile) and the
     **`sensitive` / non-cached message flag** (§6.7 — a message the client MUST NOT persist at
     rest) further shrink what a later seizure can reveal; implementations SHOULD offer both.

   **After all of that**, one residual is irreducible: a device **actively compromised while
   unlocked and in use** sees exactly what the *user* sees — it can read decrypted content and
   exercise the (hardware-held) key in real time. **No protocol can prevent an authorized,
   unlocked endpoint from reading its own screen.** DMTAP shrinks endpoint compromise to precisely
   this floor — live, unlocked, in-use — rather than the old "any seized cluster member leaks the
   whole history." That is the honest boundary *after* the maximal defense, not in place of it.
4. **First-contact MITM.** Before KT/OOB verification, the *first* name→key resolution can be
   MITM'd; DMTAP fails closed if KT is unreachable at first contact (§3.3, §3.4).
5. **Metadata privacy is weakest-link.** One leaky component (a bad lookup, a client bug, a
   timing side-channel) can unravel graph privacy. It is harder to *achieve* than to *design*;
   implementations MUST be conservative and audited.
6. **v0 key transparency is not equivocation-proof.** A v0 single, non-gossiped KT log can show
   different histories to different observers (split-view) until v1 gossip/multi-log auditing
   exists (§3.5). In v0, KT is **tamper-evident-after-the-fact and self-monitorable, but not a
   trusted single source** — a network SHOULD run multiple independent logs even in v0, and
   clients MUST treat a single unaudited log as advisory (§3.5.1, §3.4.1), leaning on OOB
   verification for high-value contacts. This is a real tension with the sovereignty goal and is
   stated as such. For **DMTAP-Auth (§13)** specifically, a split view is a **silent per-RP
   account takeover**, so high-value login RPs MUST require **multi-log consistency or an
   OOB-verified pin even in v0** — the owning requirement is §13.7 item 6.
7. **Group handshake ordering is a metadata concentration point.** The per-group committer/
   ordering channel (§5.1) necessarily sees all of a group's handshake traffic; this is an
   explicit exception to the "no single node sees both ends" framing, bounded by rotating the
   committer and keeping application traffic on the mixnet. **Additionally, in v0 the ordered,
   reliable handshake channel is not itself required to ride the mixnet** (§5.1 routes it for
   liveness), so a *network* observer — not only the committer — can see the timing of membership
   changes (Add/Remove Commits, Welcomes), which is membership-graph metadata the mixnet otherwise
   hides. Application traffic stays cover-indistinguishable; the handshake channel does not. Closing
   this fully (carrying handshakes over the `private` tier, realizing "ordered/reliable" as the
   committer's on-arrival log order rather than an in-transit bypass, and bringing any retained
   low-latency committer path under the §4.4.9 no-silent-downgrade rule) is a tracked v0 residual.
8. **`redact`/`expires` are unenforceable** against a non-compliant recipient that already holds
   the plaintext — they are cooperative hints, not guarantees (relevant to any "right to
   erasure" framing).
9. **Push wake-signaling on platforms that mandate a push service.** The wake-signaling layer
   (§4.9) is content-free, sender-blind, node-originated, and RFC 8291-encrypted, and on
   Android / desktop / web it can run **fully open and self-hosted** over UnifiedPush or Web Push
   (§4.9.3) — a push relay there sees nothing but a **self-edge** ("this node woke its own
   device"), never a sender, a correspondent, or any content. **On iOS, however, the OS mandates
   APNs**: a background app cannot be woken except through Apple's push service, so on iOS **Apple
   sees timing metadata** — that *this device* was pinged at time *T* — even though the wake carries
   no sender, no subject, and no content (it is opaque ciphertext, §4.9.1), and even though the node
   MAY jitter/batch wakes to blunt correlation (§4.9.1). This residual is **disclosed and minimized,
   not hidden**: DMTAP strips the payload and the social graph from the wake, but it cannot remove
   Apple from the loop on a platform that forbids any other wake path. It is the push analogue of the
   global-active-adversary residual (item 1) — the maximal open mechanism is applied first, and the
   irreducible **platform-mandated** leak is stated plainly rather than papered over. Where the
   platform permits an open provider (UnifiedPush / Web Push), this residual does not arise at all.
   Because a per-arrival wake is itself an activity-dependent timing signal *outside* the mixnet's
   cover traffic, it composes with item 1: under the **High-security profile** (§4.4.10) wake
   jitter/batching is therefore a **MUST** (§4.9.1), so the wake path does not reintroduce the
   recipient-arrival timing channel the profile's constant-rate cover closes.
10. **Referenced-file availability is a contract, not a property of the hash.** A content address
    stays useful only while **some node still serves the bytes**, so "forever access even after the
    peer drops" is **not free**. DMTAP does not treat this as unaddressed: **Inline** files are
    durable-by-delivery and **Attached** files are pushed into the recipient's own store (§5.5.1),
    so neither depends on the sender staying online; a **Referenced** file carries an explicit
    **durability class** (§5.5.2) and clients **SHOULD auto-pull-and-pin** small referenced files
    to convert best-effort → durable. **After all that**, one residual is irreducible: a Referenced
    file left at the **origin-hold** default (best-effort, no pin, no replica) **MAY become
    permanently unavailable** if the origin node drops before the recipient fetches
    (`ERR_FILE_UNAVAILABLE`, §21) — a **durability**, not a confidentiality, limit. It is closed by
    choosing `recipient-pinned`, `cluster-replicated(N)`, or `pinned(term)` (§5.5.2), each of which
    costs real storage; the default is disclosed as best-effort rather than silently implying
    permanence. Relatedly, **deletion is cooperative-only**: you can stop serving *your* copy but
    **cannot force-delete** bytes another party has pinned (§5.5.4) — the storage analogue of the
    `redact`/`expires` un-share bound (item 8).
11. **Publishing a public object (§22) is irrevocable.** Unlike a sealed file (item 10, item 8),
    a DMTAP-PUB object is content-addressed and swarmed by design — once published, it **cannot
    be unpublished**: any holder may continue serving it indefinitely, and there is no protocol
    mechanism to force its removal from the network. Publication is a deliberate, one-way act
    (§22), not a reversible share.
12. **Holders of public objects are not blind.** A sealed-file holder serves opaque ciphertext
    (item 5.5, §5.5.3) and cannot inspect it; a DMTAP-PUB holder serves **plaintext** it can read.
    Serving public content therefore shifts an operator's moderation/liability posture in a way
    serving sealed chunks does not — hence public-object serving is a **per-operator opt-in**,
    never a default-on behavior of a conformant node; the owning requirement is §22, negotiated
    as the `pub-1` capability (§10.2).
13. **The volunteer infrastructure may simply fail to materialise.** DMTAP has no commercial engine
    behind its infrastructure: the mixnet, the KT log set, the rendezvous layer and the buffer
    holders are all **roles taken reciprocally by participants** (§0.2.2, §4.4.2a, §14.1), not
    services anyone is paid to provide. Defaults are set to make provision automatic where the cost
    is negligible — the mix role is default-on for always-on public nodes — but a **default is not a
    guarantee**. If too few nodes take these roles, the honest consequence is: `private`-tier paths
    become unbuildable, and delivery **degrades to the `fast` tier** (§4.6) — still end-to-end
    encrypted, still authenticated, still sealed-sender, but **without default metadata privacy**,
    with the graph observable to a network observer (§6.5). The intermediate state is named rather
    than hidden (the **Bootstrap profile**, §4.4.10a, which carries no anonymity claim), the
    fail-closed rule still forbids a *silent* downgrade (§4.4.9), and the network's actual capacity
    is publishable and checkable (§14.6.3). This is the price of having nobody paid to keep the
    lights on, stated up front instead of discovered later.
14. **A third-party gateway reads your inbound legacy mail in the clear.** The legacy leg is
    plaintext by construction (§7.10.4), and a gateway serving legacy *clients* must decrypt the
    mailbox to speak IMAP/POP/DAV at all (§7.15.3). Now that "operator" means **whoever chose to
    run the role** (§0.2.3) rather than a vetted commercial provider, this deserves sharpening: the
    party reading that mail is an ordinary volunteer or acquaintance with a reputable IP, subject to
    whatever jurisdiction and whatever operational hygiene they happen to have. DMTAP's mitigations
    are real but bounded — the mode is **declared and enforced** (§7.15.4), gateway-touched mail is
    **marked** to the recipient (§7.8), and the native path never touches a gateway at all (§7.7).
    **Recommendation:** where legacy privacy matters, run the gateway role **yourself** (`private`
    mode, §7.15.4, §7.1a) so the only party who can read it is you. Where you cannot, treat a
    third-party gateway exactly as you would treat any hosted mail provider — because that is what
    it is.
15. **A legacy sender cannot verify that a gateway resolved a chain name honestly.** When mail is
    addressed to `alice.sol@gw.example.net` (§7.10.5a), the gateway performs the SNS/ENS lookup and
    the legacy sender has **no way to check the result**: legacy SMTP carries no cryptography with
    which to bind "the key this name resolved to" to anything the sender can verify, and DMARC/DKIM
    authenticate the *sending* domain, never the *recipient* resolution. A malicious or compromised
    gateway could therefore route mail addressed to a chain name to a key of its choosing, and the
    legacy sender would see a perfectly normal delivery. This is **inherent to legacy having no
    cryptography**, not a defect introduced by the mapping — the same exposure exists for every
    alias form and, in truth, for ordinary MX-based mail routing today. It is bounded on the DMTAP
    side: a *native* sender resolves the chain name itself and verifies the binding bidirectionally
    and against KT (§3.12.5(b), §3.12.3), so the exposure exists only for correspondents who are
    still on legacy — and shrinks as they leave (§7.1c).

16. **A key-name identifies an identity; it does not, on its own, address one.** The key-name is a
    **one-way** digest of the identity key — 80 bits of `BLAKE3-256(ik)` (§18.9.17, §3.9.6). Given
    the key you can compute and confirm the name; **given only the name you cannot recover the
    key**, and the key is what every addressing primitive actually consumes: the HPKE seal (§2.4),
    the `DeliveryTag` (§2.2a), a work proof's `recipient` scope (§9.4), and the DHT lookup key
    `hash(ik)` itself (§4.2). A stranger holding only a spoken or printed key-name therefore holds
    a **checksum, not an address**, and must obtain the key out of band — QR, contact card,
    introduction (§3.13.5).
    The only mechanism that could close this for an identity with *no* domain, *no* chain and *no*
    contacts is a DHT lookup keyed on `hash(ik)`. This specification deliberately relegates the
    DHT to **opportunistic use only** and states that no relationship should depend on it (§4.2.1),
    because §4.2's CAUTION identifies it as the single most attackable surface in the protocol and
    notes that IP-diversity caps are close to worthless under IPv6. So for the cold-start,
    key-name-only user of §3.13.5, **first contact is DHT-dependent and therefore eclipse-deniable**:
    an adversary who eclipses the neighbourhood of `hash(ik)` can make that identity unfindable to
    strangers while it remains perfectly nameable, verifiable, and deliverable-to once found.
    §9.7a's floor guarantees **acceptance**, not **reachability**; §3.13.4's guarantee is therefore
    stated as reachable *by anyone who has your key*, and that qualifier is the honest one. The
    practical mitigation is the one §3.13.5 already recommends for its own reasons: out-of-band
    introduction is the primary first-contact path, and it carries the key rather than only its
    digest.
17. **Offline/buffered recipients are served by the polled shared store PIR exists to remove —
    and DMTAP does not remove it.** §6.4's push-delivery argument holds only for an **always-on**
    recipient node. Any recipient that is not continuously reachable — a phone, a laptop, anything
    that sleeps or loses connectivity, which is the **common** case, not the exception — is served
    instead by the **content-blind relay-mailbox / peer buffer** of §14.5: ciphertext is held there
    for the offline-buffer TTL (§16.6) and **retrieved by the recipient polling it on return**.
    This is, precisely, the untrusted-shared-store exposure PIR was designed to remove, restated
    for a mailbox instead of a database: a party able to observe the buffer learns **which
    per-recipient delivery tag was polled, when, and how much ciphertext moved** — arrival timing
    and volume — every time a buffered device comes back online. Content stays sealed (the buffer
    is content-blind, §14.5) but the **access pattern** is exactly what PIR exists to hide, and
    DMTAP does not hide it: it neither runs PIR against the buffer nor specifies an unlinkable
    retrieval ceremony that would. An earlier revision of §6.4 described retrieval as happening
    "via an unlinkable dead-drop token over the mixnet" — a phrase defined nowhere in this
    specification (no object, no derivation, no state machine) — and that claim is withdrawn as
    false comfort, not merely unspecified. Closing this residual for real is a materially larger
    undertaking than the always-on push path this specification actually builds: either running
    PIR against the buffer (the cost §6.4 declines to pay) or fully specifying a blinded dead-drop
    protocol — its own unlinkable-pickup credential, a defined wire object, and a retrieval state
    machine, none of which exist today. Neither is done here. §14.5 owns the buffer mechanism and
    MUST NOT describe retrieval as anonymous or unlinkable until one of these is actually
    specified; until then, a buffered/offline recipient's arrival-timing and volume metadata is a
    disclosed gap in the metadata-privacy guarantee (§6.1), not a covered case of it.
18. **A vouch (§9.7) discloses three identities in cleartext to buy the strongest cold-contact
    standing in the protocol — a structural exception, not a bug.** Every other cold-contact
    mechanism (ARC, PoW, postage, §9.3–§9.5) is evaluated on the sealed envelope without revealing
    who anyone is. A `Vouch` (§18.3.3) cannot follow that pattern: it *is* the voucher's, the
    subject's (the sender's), and the recipient's identity keys plus a signed introduction, and
    §9.2a requires it to ride the cleartext envelope so the recipient's gate can check it before
    decryption (§2.7 step 6). Every exit mix and any on-path observer of that hop reads all three
    identities on any first-contact MOTE that presents one. This is not the theft/replay hole
    §9.2a and §2.7 step 8(b2) close (a different, narrower defect, since fixed) — it is what the
    mechanism discloses exactly as designed, exactly when the sender presenting it most needed
    protection. §9.1 principle 4 and §9.7's own honest-limit clause state this precisely; §6.9
    SP-11 and SP-5 state its effect on those two claims. Closing it requires restructuring §2.7
    around a decrypt-then-gate path for the vouch case, or replacing the vouch with a blinded
    ARC-style presentation; this specification discloses the exposure rather than choosing between
    those fixes.

DMTAP states these boundaries in-product. Honest, disclosed limits beat a false "perfectly
anonymous."

## 6.7 Data at rest

- The node encrypts the mailbox, file blobs, and keys **at rest** under a device/identity key.
- **Unlock-gated store encryption (normative, MUST).** The at-rest key MUST be **released
  only on device unlock** — wrapped by a key the hardware keystore (§1.2a) yields only after a
  successful biometric/PIN authentication, and **evicted from memory on relock/timeout** (§16.9).
  The sole exception is a platform with **no unlock signal** (e.g. a headless always-on box with
  no lock/unlock concept), which MUST instead seal the at-rest key to the strongest available
  boot-time protection (keystore-sealed / full-disk) — the relock eviction it cannot observe
  does not apply, and everything else here does. This distinguishes two threat cases sharply: an
  **offline-seized** device (powered off or locked) yields only inert ciphertext (**defended**);
  a **live, unlocked, in-use** device can read what the user reads (**the residual**, §6.6
  item 3). Implementations MUST NOT keep the at-rest key resident indefinitely across a locked
  device.
- **`sensitive` / non-cached messages (normative, MAY-send / MUST-honor).** A sender MAY mark a
  message `sensitive` (a `Headers` flag, §18.3.6): the receiving client **MUST NOT persist it at
  rest** — it is held in memory for an ephemeral view and dropped, never written to the durable
  MOTE store — so a *later* seizure reveals nothing of it. Like `redact`/`expires` (§6.6 item 8)
  this is **cooperative** (a non-compliant or compromised recipient can still copy what it can
  read); it is a least-persistence reduction, not a guarantee against a live endpoint.
- **Lost/stolen-device flow (normative).** On suspected device compromise the owner (from any
  surviving cluster device, or after recovery §1.4) performs: (1) an **MLS Remove** of the lost
  device from every group (§5.8.2) and, for a personal cluster, from the device group (§5.6);
  (2) a **device-key rotation** (§1.5) re-keying any identity/recovery material the device held;
  (3) **session revocation** of all that device's auth sessions (§13.4, which a device-key
  rotation triggers wholesale); and (4) **deniable-session teardown** — because the pairwise
  Double Ratchet lies **outside** MLS, an MLS Remove does not reach it, so the owner MUST also run
  the §5.2.1(f) flow: withdraw/rotate the deniable prekeys (`idk`/`spk`/`opks`) the device could
  have held, tear down its in-flight ratchets, and **re-establish** any deniable conversation to
  restore post-compromise security. Steps (1)–(2) advance every affected MLS epoch and step (4)
  reboots each deniable ratchet, so the evicted key has **post-compromise** — it decrypts no
  message sent after the eviction. This reuses existing machinery (§1.5, §5.8.2, §13.4, §5.2.1(f));
  no new revocation protocol is introduced.
- Messages get MLS **forward secrecy**; files use **per-file keys** (blast radius = one file)
  delivered over the forward-secret channel. Persistent, re-readable data cannot ratchet like
  ephemeral messages — this is a property of files, not a DMTAP flaw (§5.5).
- **Access revocation on group-member removal (normative).** MLS removal blocks a removed
  member's *future* messages but does NOT revoke file keys they already hold. Therefore, when a
  member is removed from a shared file folder (§5.5), the node MUST **re-key and re-encrypt**
  every file the removed member had access to **by default**, and redistribute the new keys to
  remaining members. **Skipping the re-key is an explicit, surfaced opt-out** (e.g. low-sensitivity
  shared media where the cost outweighs the benefit), never the silent default; folders marked
  **confidential** MUST always re-key (opt-out forbidden). Without a re-key, a removed member
  retains indefinite read access to already-shared files. Clients MUST surface that pre-removal copies a
  member already downloaded cannot be recalled — deletion/recall is cooperative-only, never a
guarantee (the un-share limit; `redact`/`expires` are unenforceable cooperative hints, §6.6 item 8).
- Recovery custody (§1.4) governs how at-rest keys survive device loss.

## 6.8 Transport-path provenance does not weaken metadata privacy (normative)

DMTAP lets a recipient learn and verify a message's **transport-path provenance** — the tier it
arrived on, whether it was gateway-touched or pure-mesh, and a coarse hop descriptor (§7.8, wire
objects §18.3.11 / §18.8.1). This is deliberately constrained so it **reveals only trust-boundary
crossings the recipient can already infer, and nothing more** — it MUST NOT weaken sealed sender
(§6.2) or mixnet anonymity (§4.4):

- **Provenance answers "which trust boundaries did this cross?", never "which nodes carried it?"**
  For the `private` tier the recipient learns only the **profile floor** the path satisfied
  (`≥ 3` / `≥ 5` hops, §4.4.10) — **never** a mix-node identity, address, exact hop count, path
  descriptor, or per-hop timing. The private path is, by design, unknown even to the recipient's
  own node (that is the anonymity guarantee, §6.2); a `ProvenanceRecord` MUST NOT contain, and a
  node MUST NOT synthesize, anything from which the path could be reconstructed (§18.8.1 privacy
  invariants). The coarse hop descriptor is a **statement about the profile**, not a trace.
- **The gateway attestation is sealed, so it leaks nothing to intermediaries.** The
  `GatewayAttestation` that marks a message gateway-touched (and names the gateway domain, time,
  and legacy sender) rides **inside the encrypted `Payload`** (§18.3.5), visible only to the
  recipient — a mixnet intermediary sees only ciphertext (§2.2, §6.2). The legacy-sender address it
  carries is the recipient's own inbound mail, which the recipient legitimately sees anyway.
- **The provenance record never leaves the owner's devices.** A `ProvenanceRecord` is node-local,
  served only over the authenticated client surface to the owner's own cluster (§8.1, §8.3,
  §19.9); it is never attached to a forwarded MOTE or exposed to a third party (§18.8.1). It adds
  **no** new on-wire field observable by any intermediary.
- **Gateway-touched vs. pure-mesh exposes only what the boundary already exposed.** A gateway leg
  is *unavoidably* plaintext (§7 opening) — provenance merely lets the recipient **see that this
  already happened**, it does not create new exposure. A pure-mesh message's "no attestation"
  state is the *absence* of a signal, which leaks nothing.

This keeps provenance consistent with the §12.3 inviolable rule: it is a **transparency** feature
over boundaries the design already makes visible, not a metadata-privacy regression.

## 6.9 Security properties (falsifiable claims → mechanism → adversary → residual)

The prose above states the threat model; this subsection states, in one place, **each security
property DMTAP claims as a falsifiable statement** — a claim an auditor or a formal tool (Tamarin,
ProVerif, a symbolic model) can attempt to **refute**. Every property is mapped to the mechanism
(§) that provides it, the adversary it holds against, and the **disclosed residual** (the §6.6 item
or the mechanism's own honest-limit clause). Nothing here is claimed *beyond* its residual: where a
property has a caveat, the caveat is part of the statement.

Two structural facts frame the whole table. **Confidentiality and authenticity (SP-1, SP-2) hold
against a global *active* adversary** — breaking them requires a signing/decryption key, which
adversary reach does not confer. **The metadata properties (SP-3–SP-5) degrade with adversary
reach**: strong against a global *passive* adversary, *bounded* (not defeated) against a global
*active* one (§6.6 item 1). This asymmetry is the honest core of DMTAP's posture.

**SP-1 — Message confidentiality (end-to-end).**
- *Claim (falsifiable):* No party other than the intended recipient(s) — no relay, mix, gateway,
  directory, KT log, or hosted operator — can recover `Payload` plaintext.
- *Holds by:* MLS group encryption / HPKE sealing of `Payload` into `Envelope.ciphertext` (§2.4,
  §2.1, §5.1); every intermediary is content-blind (§6.1, §6.2).
- *Against:* network eavesdropper, malicious relay/mix, curious directory/KT, and a global
  **passive and active** adversary alike (confidentiality does not degrade with global reach
  *once the name→key binding is established* — a first-contact MITM before KT/OOB is the disclosed
  residual below).
- *Residual:* the endpoint floor — a device compromised while unlocked and in use reads its own
  plaintext (§6.6 item 3); the legacy-gateway leg is plaintext by construction (§7 opening); a
  first-contact MITM before KT/OOB can substitute the encryption key (§6.6 item 4). Harvest-now:
  content is PQ-migratable (suite `0x02`, §1.1) but v0 classical-suite ciphertext recorded today is
  exposed to a future quantum break until the identity migrates (§4.4.12 content note).

**SP-2 — Content authenticity & integrity.**
- *Claim:* A recipient accepts a `Payload` as authored by identity `IK` only if `IK` actually
  signed it, and detects any bit-flip of a MOTE.
- *Holds by:* `Payload.sig` verified under `Payload.from` at §2.7 step 8; content-address `id`
  (BLAKE3-256 of `ciphertext`) checked at §2.7 step 2 (§2.2); canonical signing/hashing preimages
  (§18.9); name→`IK` binding via pinning + KT (§3.4, §3.5).
- *Against:* all adversaries incl. global active (forgery needs the signing key).
- *Residual:* authenticity of the *name→key binding* is only as strong as the KT profile in force
  (SP-9, §6.6 item 6); deniable-mode messages deliberately carry **no** content signature — their
  authenticator is a shared-key MAC (SP-7, §5.2.1(c)).

**SP-3 — Sender anonymity against a GLOBAL PASSIVE adversary (the headline property).**
- *Claim:* A global passive adversary observing all links and all timing cannot learn who sent a
  `private`-tier MOTE to whom, beyond the disclosed residual.
- *Holds by:* sealed sender (identity + authenticating signature sealed inside the payload, §2.2,
  §6.2); Sphinx onion routing + memoryless Poisson mixing (§4.4.1, §4.4.6); mandatory cover traffic
  + size-bucket padding (§4.4.5, §6.3); mixnet-routed lookups (§3.7).
- *Against:* the global **passive** adversary — DMTAP's primary/headline target (§6.1).
- *Residual:* metadata *reduction*, not elimination — sealed sender is statistically eroded by
  receipt/timing side channels (Martiny et al., NDSS 2021), which is why cover traffic is
  load-bearing, not optional (§6.2); last-hop delivery observability remains (§6.4 items 1–3);
  long-term intersection is bounded, not eliminated (§6.6 item 5, §4.4.8); while the fleet is small
  the guarantee is Tor-with-few-relays, not a strong global mixnet (§4.4.11); the v0 onion is not PQ
  — a harvest-now adversary could retroactively deanonymize the recorded social graph (§4.4.12).

**SP-4 — Sender anonymity against a GLOBAL ACTIVE adversary (reduced and disclosed).**
- *Claim:* A global *active* adversary (inject/drop/delay at will) is forced to pay latency and/or
  bandwidth to correlate, and its drop/delay/flooding is **detected and responded to** — but it is
  **not fully defeated**.
- *Holds by:* per-epoch replay caches, tagging-resistant Sphinx (header MAC `γ` + wide-block LIONESS
  payload PRP), memoryless Poisson mixing (§4.4.6); loop-cover active-attack detection →
  rotate + `HALT_ALERT` + fail-closed (§4.4.7); entry guards + **attested** operator-diversity
  (§4.4.8); fail-closed no-downgrade (§4.4.9); the user-selectable High-security profile (§4.4.10).
- *Against:* the global **active** adversary.
- *Residual (bounded, not eliminated):* the Anonymity Trilemma floor (§6.6 item 1, Das et al.,
  IEEE S&P 2018) — strong anonymity provably cannot be free; sub-threshold selective dropping stays
  under the §4.4.7 detector (§6.6 item 1, §16.3); the colluding entry+exit floor is ≈ *f*² and is
  **not** reduced by adding hops (§4.4.10). DMTAP *approaches* the mathematical floor as the
  profile's latency/overhead grows; it does not claim to defeat an omnipotent active adversary. The
  mechanism-model simulation corroborating this shape (chance-floor convergence, 20%-loss detection,
  ≈ *f*² collusion, hops-≠-collusion-defense) is reported — with its honest caveats — in §6.10.

**SP-5 — Recipient unlinkability (blinded delivery tags) — scoped to established contact.**
- *Claim:* For an **established contact** (steady-state delivery, `to = BlindedTag`), an observer
  cannot link successive `private`-tier deliveries to the same recipient *by the routing tag*, nor
  tie that tag to the recipient's persistent identity key. **This claim does not extend to a
  first-contact/cold delivery**, which is a distinct case addressed in the residual below, not a
  weaker instance of this one.
- *Holds by:* blinded delivery tag `BT = HKDF(shared_secret, epoch_day)`, recognized by the
  recipient but unlinkable across time and across observers (§2.2a); network/human identity
  decoupling and recipient-side cover (§6.4).
- *Against:* a global passive adversary / final mix, for the *tag-linkage* property, on the
  established-contact path only.
- *Residual (stated, not overclaimed):* blinding removes the persistent-key linkage in the envelope;
  it does **not** hide *that a packet was delivered to a particular always-on node* — a stable
  network presence is itself a fingerprint (§6.4 item 1, §2.2a). Recipient-side cover (§4.4.5) blurs
  receipt *timing* but does not erase last-hop observability. Implementations MUST NOT present
  blinded tags as full recipient anonymity (§2.2a). This is a *reduction*, not a solved property.
  **On the cold/first-contact path, DMTAP makes no recipient-unlinkability claim at all, and the
  gap is total, not partial:** a cold envelope's `to` is `KeyTag` — the recipient's own identity
  key, in cleartext, by construction (§2.2a) — and the anti-abuse `challenge` it carries
  independently names the recipient in cleartext too: `ArcToken.origin` (MUST match the verifying
  node's origin), `PostageStamp.audience`, and `PowSolution`'s recipient-bound epoch scope
  (`id ‖ recipient ‖ nonce(epoch)`, §9.2a, §9.4) each identify the recipient to whichever exit mix
  and on-path observer see the unwrapped envelope. These fields are redundant with the already-
  disclosed `KeyTag` on the cold path today, but they mean that blinding `to` alone would not, by
  itself, buy cold-path recipient unlinkability even if a future revision found a way to avoid the
  `KeyTag` requirement — the challenge fields would still leak the recipient independently. A
  `Vouch` (§9.7) additionally leaks the *sender's* and the voucher's identity on the same cold
  message; that is §6.6 item 18 and §6.9 SP-11's residual, not this claim's.

**SP-6 — Forward secrecy & post-compromise security — scoped to an established session.**
- *Claim:* Once an MLS session (group or 2-party) exists, compromise of a party's current keys
  does not expose its past messages (FS), and after a Commit/epoch advance an evicted key cannot
  decrypt future messages (PCS). **This claim applies only from the point a session's first epoch
  exists.** It does not apply, and is not weakened-but-still-partially-true for, a MOTE sent before
  one does — that case is a distinct, disclosed gap stated in the residual below, not a bounded
  degradation of this claim.
- *Holds by:* MLS TreeKEM epoch advancement (§5.1, §5.2); mix-key epoch rotation + deletion at
  `valid_until` gives the mixnet FS against later node seizure (§4.4.4); per-file keys for at-rest
  blobs (§6.7); the optional deniable mode adds *per-message* FS/PCS via the Double Ratchet
  (§5.2.1(b)).
- *Against:* an adversary that later seizes a device or mix (FS), and a bounded-duration endpoint
  compromise that is subsequently revoked (PCS) — for traffic carried inside an established
  session.
- *Residual:* MLS PCS is **per-epoch/per-Commit**, coarser than Double-Ratchet per-message healing —
  a deliberate simplicity trade, not a strict improvement (§5.2); persistent files cannot ratchet
  (§6.7); deniable-mode PCS needs *bidirectional* traffic — a send-only channel retains only FS
  (§5.2.1(b)); PCS heals only *after* the evict/rotate flow runs (§6.7).
  **The default 1:1/first-contact path has no forward secrecy at all, stated plainly.** A
  first-contact (or otherwise pre-session) MOTE is HPKE-sealed directly to the recipient's
  identity/KeyPackage key, with `Envelope.epoch` absent (§2.2) — a single HPKE seal, not a
  ratchet. Compromise of that recipient key at **any later time** exposes that message; there is
  no epoch to have advanced past and no key deletion schedule that protects it. This is not a
  weaker version of the residuals above; it is the **entire claim not yet applying**, for exactly
  the messages a cold or new contact sends before any Commit/Welcome establishes a first epoch
  (§5.3). The optional deniable 1:1 mode (SP-7) is the one path that supplies per-message FS/PCS
  from its first message, because its Double Ratchet does not wait on an MLS epoch; a sender who
  needs FS before a session exists and does not want deniability has no other option in this
  specification today. (An earlier revision carried an undefined `fs_ratchet` field that could be
  misread as filling this gap; it supplied no derivation, no verifier, and no semantics anywhere
  in the corpus, and has been removed — see §2.4's note — rather than left to imply a mechanism
  that was never specified.)

**SP-7 — Deniability / repudiation (optional 1:1 mode).**
- *Claim:* In the opt-in deniable 1:1 mode, neither party — nor a third party — can produce a
  *cryptographic* proof, from ciphertext and keys alone, that the *other* party authored a given
  message.
- *Holds by:* a separate pairwise X3DH/PQXDH + Double-Ratchet channel authenticated by a
  **shared-key MAC** (either party could forge it) run beside the 2-member MLS group; every
  long-term signature covers only a *public key*, never content; a `DeniablePayload` carrying a
  signature is rejected (`0x040F`) (§5.2.1(a)–(c)).
- *Against:* a judge given only the cryptographic transcript.
- *Residual (bounds):* the **default MLS path is non-repudiable** — deniability is opt-in, 1:1 only;
  groups (n ≥ 3) stay attributable (§5.2, §5.2.1(d)). It is **not** endpoint protection — a
  logged/coerced endpoint's plaintext still discloses content (§5.2.1(e) item 1 = §6.6 item 3). X3DH
  *online/interactive* deniability is weaker than its offline form (Vatandas et al., ACNS 2020);
  DMTAP claims **no more than Signal's proven guarantees** (§5.2.1(e) item 2).

**SP-8 — Downgrade resistance.**
- *Claim:* An adversary cannot **silently** force a party onto a weaker suite, tier, profile, or
  capability set; every downgrade is either refused (fail-closed) or a deliberate, user-surfaced
  choice.
- *Holds by:* unknown `v`/`suite` rejected fail-closed (§10.1); per-contact suite high-water-mark
  ratchet (§1.3, `0x020F`); fail-closed no `private → fast` and no High-security → Standard
  downgrade (§4.4.9, `0x0310`); monotonic capability announcements (§10.2, `0x030A`); deniable-mode
  no-silent-downgrade (§5.2.1(d), `0x040E`). These rules are collected and audited as a **set** in
  §10.7.
- *Against:* a global active adversary (DoS-to-downgrade) and an on-path MITM.
- *Residual:* enforcement is per-recipient and local, so it is only as good as the implementation —
  "metadata privacy is weakest-link" (§6.6 item 5); a suite high-water-mark lowers **only** through
  an explicit `IK`-authorized retirement the owner performs (§1.3), never via an inbound message.

**SP-9 — Key transparency / equivocation detection (profile-dependent — stated honestly).**
- *Claim:* Under **v1-hardening KT** (log-type `0x02`, §3.5.2) a log that shows different
  `name → ik` histories to different observers (split view) is **detected, attributed, and responded
  to** — HALT_ALERT + evict, fail-closed below a `> n/2` quorum. Under **v0-minimal KT** (log-type
  `0x01`, §3.5.1) equivocation is only **tamper-evident-after-the-fact and deterred — NOT reliably
  detected.**
- *Holds by:* v1 STH gossip + consistency proofs, multi-log `> n/2` quorum, monitor/auditor roles,
  equivocation halt (§3.5.2, `0x0107`/`0x0110`/`0x0111`/`0x0112`); v0 fail-closed-on-unreachable +
  owner self-monitoring (§3.3, §3.5.1, `0x0106`).
- *Against:* a malicious or split-view KT log (v1: detected; v0: only deterred).
- *Residual:* **v0 KT is not equivocation-proof (§6.6 item 6)** — the honest core limit; this is the
  one property whose strength is *gated on the negotiated profile*, and the spec does **not** claim
  v0 delivers it. High-value contacts, and every DMTAP-Auth login RP, MUST require multi-log
  consistency or an OOB-verified pin even in v0 (§3.4.1, §13.7).

**SP-10 — Recoverability from key/device compromise.**
- *Claim:* An owner can recover identity **and all relationships** after losing or having a
  device/factor compromised, and a *partial* compromise cannot silently escalate to an
  owner-evicting takeover.
- *Holds by:* versioned signed `RecoveryPolicy` with distinct `recover_threshold`/`rotate_threshold`
  (§1.4); weakening-needs-quorum-even-under-`IK` + an asymmetric **72 h** veto window (§1.4 rules
  3–4, §16); real revocation by re-key / VSS / redistribution / FROST (§1.4 rule 5); cross-signed
  `IK` rotation chain (§1.5); MLS Remove + device-key rotation + deniable teardown heal the cluster
  forward (§6.7, §1.2a, §5.2.1(f)); recovery invalidates prior sessions (§13.4, `0x050A`).
- *Against:* device loss, single-factor theft, and a stolen-`IK`-alone proactive takeover attempt.
- *Residual:* losing `IK` **and** enough factors simultaneously is unrecoverable; obtaining `IK`
  **plus** a `rotate_threshold` quorum of factors is an owner-unrecoverable takeover — *worse* than
  loss (§1.4 "bottom turtle"). Recovery restores the **key**, not prior **content**, absent a
  surviving cluster device or an encrypted backup (§1.4 backup/restore).

**SP-11 — Anti-abuse without deanonymization — scoped to ARC, PoW, and postage; the vouch is
excluded, not covered.**
- *Claim:* A recipient can rate-limit and block a cold sender presenting an **ARC token, PoW
  solution, or postage stamp** (§9.3–§9.5) **without learning who they are** and **without linking
  a sender across recipients**. **This claim does not extend to the vouch (§9.7).** Presenting a
  vouch is a deliberate, disclosed exception, not a weaker instance of the same guarantee: it
  reveals the sender's, the voucher's, and the recipient's identity keys in cleartext to the
  mixnet's exit hop and any on-path observer of that hop (§9.2a, §18.3.3) — the opposite of what
  this claim states for the other three mechanisms. An implementation MUST NOT read this claim as
  covering vouch-based cold contact.
- *Holds by (for ARC/PoW/postage):* ARC anonymous, per-origin-scoped, rate-limited tokens (§9.3),
  PoW fallback (§9.4), and postage (§9.5), all evaluated on the sealed envelope **before
  decryption** (§2.7 step 6), each bound to the ephemeral `sender_key` to defeat proof theft/replay
  (§9.2a); the anonymity-preserved principle (§9.1 item 4), which these three mechanisms satisfy
  without exception.
- *Against:* a recipient (and its operator) attempting to deanonymize or cross-link a sender using
  ARC, PoW, or postage.
- *Residual:* repeat abuse is bounded at the **issuer** layer, not the recipient layer —
  recipient-side cross-recipient linking is deliberately unavailable and not claimed (§9.3.2); an
  unvetted/self-issued token carries a **zero** budget (§9.3.1); a hidden-membership list's committer
  holds a disclosed per-delivery vouch-trust power (§9.9). Mix-layer flooding is bounded only by
  content-blind controls (per-connection/operator rate limits + attested operator diversity, §9.8).
  **The vouch's exposure is not a residual of this claim — it is a carve-out from it.** §9.1
  principle 4 states the exception normatively; §9.7's honest-limit clause and §6.6 item 18 state
  the mechanism and its consequence in full: every exit mix and on-path observer of the final hop
  reads the voucher's, subject's, and recipient's identity keys on any first-contact MOTE
  presenting a vouch. Implementations MUST disclose this to a sender before offering vouch as a
  cold-contact option (§9.7) and MUST NOT market or default to vouch as though it carried the same
  anonymity property as ARC, PoW, or postage.

above** — without invoking its stated residual — has found a spec-level defect, and it MUST be
filed as such (§10.4). That is the point of stating them falsifiably.

**Where the formal models live.** This specification repository ships the **CDDL** wire grammars
(§18) and the conformance vectors (§10.3); the **symbolic/ProVerif protocol models** that exercise
the SP-*n* claims are maintained in the **reference implementation's `formal/` directory** (the
Envoir monorepo), not in this spec repo. They are versioned against the mechanisms cited above and
are the executable counterpart to this falsifiable-claims table; a divergence between a model and
this text is resolved in favor of the **spec** (§10.4).

## 6.10 Measured anonymity evidence (mechanism-model simulation — supporting, not deployment proof)

The §6.9 properties are stated to be **refutable**; this subsection reports what a **mixnet
anonymity simulator** in the reference measured when the §4.4 mechanisms were exercised against a
global adversary. It is offered as **corroborating evidence** for SP-3/SP-4 (and the §6.6 item 1
honest floor), and it is **explicitly caveated**:

> **This is a mechanism-model simulation, NOT the deployed network.** The simulator models the
> §4.4 constructions — Poisson per-hop mixing, loop/drop cover, stratified path selection, entry
> guards, operator diversity, and colluding-mix placement — under an idealized traffic model. It
> is a *sanity check that the mechanisms behave as designed in the abstract*, not a measurement of
> a real fleet, and it is **not a substitute** for the pre-deployment external audit gate
> (§12.8.4). Real-world anonymity depends on the live anonymity set (§4.4.11), implementation
> fidelity (the weakest-link caveat, §6.6 item 5), and side channels a mechanism model does not
> capture. No production claim rests on these numbers.

With that caveat, the simulator's four measured findings each map to a claimed property:

1. **Passive correlation converges toward the 1/N chance floor as cover and hops grow.** Against a
   *global passive* adversary, the simulated probability of correctly linking a target's sender to
   its receiver fell toward **1/N** (N = the anonymity set — indistinguishable senders) as
   cover-traffic rate and hop count increased: with enough cover and mixing, the adversary's
   guess approached a **uniform random guess over the anonymity set**. This is the mechanism-model
   evidence for **SP-3** (sender anonymity vs. global passive) and shows *why* cover traffic is
   load-bearing, not optional (§6.2, §4.4.5) — the convergence is *to* the floor, not *below* it,
   and it is a floor set by N, i.e. by adoption (§4.4.11), which the model idealizes.

2. **Active drop attacks are detected at the 20%-loss loop threshold.** When the simulated
   adversary dropped packets on a target's paths, the **loop-cover return fraction** (§4.4.7) fell
   below its detection threshold at ≈ **20% loss** (§16.3), triggering the inferred-active-attack
   response — rotate + `HALT_ALERT` + fail-closed (`0x030F`). This is the evidence for **SP-4**'s
   "drop/delay is *detected and responded to*": above-threshold suppression is caught; the honest
   residual is **sub-threshold** dropping (< 20%), which stays under the detector but, dropping so
   little, accomplishes correspondingly little (§6.6 item 1). Faster loops (High-security, §4.4.10)
   tighten this floor.

3. **Anonymity degrades with the compromised fraction f, tracking ≈ f².** As the fraction *f* of
   mixes under adversary control grew, the simulated deanonymization probability rose **≈ f²** —
   the joint probability that **both** the entry **and** the exit of a path are adversarial, the
   placement from which a colluding pair correlates a flow. This is the quantitative shape of the
   §4.4.8 bound and of the §6.6 item 1 residual: entry guards + **attested** operator diversity
   (§4.4.8) are what hold the exponent at ≈ *f*² rather than letting a single Sybil operator faking
   *N* identities collapse it to ≈ *f* (§4.4.8, §10.7.2). It also quantifies **SP-4**'s "bounded,
   not eliminated" — the bound is ≈ *f*², not zero.

4. **More hops defend against timing correlation but NOT against colluding entry+exit mixes.** The
   single most important honesty result: increasing the hop count in the simulation **lowered the
   timing-correlation success of a network *observer*** (more memoryless hops to defeat, finding 1),
   but left the **≈ f² colluding-entry+exit deanonymization essentially unchanged** — adding honest
   middle hops does not reduce the chance that the two *ends* are both adversarial. Hop count and
   operator diversity therefore defend **different** attacks: hops buy timing-correlation resistance
   (against observers), diversity + guards buy entry+exit-collusion resistance (against colluding
   mixes), and **neither substitutes for the other** (§4.4.10). Any claim that "just add more hops"
   defeats a colluding-endpoint adversary is refuted by this measurement; the normative
   prohibition on making that claim is owned by §6.6 item 1 — this section stays informative.

**Honest reading.** These results *support* the claims exactly as §6.9 states them and *refute* the
overclaims §6.6 disallows: passive correlation is driven to the chance floor (not below), active
dropping is detected (above threshold, not below), and the colluding-endpoint residual is a real
≈ *f*² floor that more hops do not remove. The evidence strengthens the honest posture; it does not
license a stronger claim than the residuals permit, and it does not replace §12.8.4's external
audit.
