# DMTAP

**Decentralized Message Transfer & Access Protocol** — an open protocol for sovereign,
metadata-private communication (mail, chat, files) and decentralized identity/login, over a
peer-to-peer mesh, with an optional bridge to legacy email.

DMTAP unifies message **transfer** (SMTP's job — deliver to an offline peer) and message
**access** (IMAP's job — sync to your devices) into one decentralized, encrypted protocol, and
extends the same keypair identity into **decentralized web login** (DMTAP-Auth, §13).

- **Protocol:** DMTAP (this repo — the neutral standard)
- **Message object:** MOTE (signed, encrypted, content-addressed)
- **Reference implementation + apps:** Envoir (open source, MIT)
- **Hosted operator (optional, paid):** Envoir Cloud (private)

DMTAP is to Envoir what Matrix is to Element, or JMAP is to Fastmail: an open standard with an
independent reference implementation and a hosted option — none required to speak the protocol.

## The specification

This is the **source of truth** for DMTAP. Independent implementations MUST be buildable from
this text alone, without reading the reference code. Where the reference implementation and this
spec disagree, **the spec wins** (or the discrepancy is a bug to reconcile).

## Conventions

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are to be
interpreted as in RFC 2119 / RFC 8174.

- **Serialization:** deterministic **CBOR** (RFC 8949 core deterministic encoding) for all
  wire objects. JSON appears only at the JMAP client boundary.
- **Hashing:** **BLAKE3** (256-bit) for content addressing unless a field specifies otherwise.
- **Signatures:** **Ed25519** (v0); algorithm identifiers make this negotiable (see §1).
- **Public-key encryption:** **HPKE** (RFC 9180) with X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 (v0).
- **Group / session security:** **MLS** (RFC 9420); async initiation uses MLS-native
  **KeyPackages + external commits** (not a separate PQXDH handshake — see §5.3).
- All multi-byte integers are big-endian. All timestamps are unsigned milliseconds since the
  Unix epoch, transported explicitly (nodes MUST NOT rely on synchronized clocks for
  correctness, only for ordering hints and expiry).

## Crypto-agility

Every signed or encrypted structure carries an **algorithm suite identifier** (`suite`).
v0 defines one classical suite and reserves identifiers for post-quantum hybrids
(Ed25519+ML-DSA for signatures, X25519+ML-KEM for KEM). Implementations MUST reject
unknown suites rather than guess. See §1 and §2.

## Non-goals

- **Real-time media (voice/video).** Different architecture (WebRTC/SFU); out of scope.
- **Perfect anonymity against a global active adversary with unlimited resources.** DMTAP
  targets strong metadata privacy against a **global passive adversary**; see §6 for the
  honest boundary.
- **Consensus / blockchain.** DMTAP uses no chain. Self-sovereign naming (§3) is the *only*
  place a name-chain is offered, as an optional name backend.
