# DMTAP

### Decentralized Message Transfer & Access Protocol

**Email, reimagined from the keypair up.** One open protocol for sovereign, end-to-end-encrypted,
metadata-private **mail · chat · files · identity** — over a peer-to-peer mesh, with an optional
bridge to the legacy email world so it works on day one.

*Your key is your identity. A name is just a pointer to it. No provider can lock you out.*

</div>

---

## The one idea

Classic email welds three things together that should never have been: **who you are** (an address
at a provider), **where your mail lives** (that provider's server), and **how you're reached** (their
IP). Lose the provider, lose everything.

DMTAP splits them into three independent layers, so an address is free of any server or IP:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  N["<b>alice@example.com</b><br/>NAME<br/><i>human · stable</i>"]
  K["<b>public key</b><br/>IDENTITY<br/><i>durable · portable</i>"]
  L["<b>current location</b><br/>IP / relay / mix path<br/><i>ephemeral · self-updated</i>"]
  N -->|"DNS + Key Transparency (§3)"| K
  K -->|"mesh DHT (§4)"| L
```

- **Name → key** lives in DNS + a key-transparency log. It changes only when you *choose* to
  migrate names.
- **Key → location** lives in the mesh — a signed, self-refreshing record, so a node behind CGNAT
  or on a dynamic IP is still reachable *by its key*.
- **The key is the identity.** Contacts route to you by key and never need DNS again after first
  contact. A lost domain is a change of *name*, not of *identity*.

## One substrate, every mode

The same keypair and the same message object (a **MOTE** — signed, encrypted, content-addressed)
carry everything. The web-login use case is the same identity: the key that receives your mail
signs you into apps, with no central identity provider.

  SUB --> LOGIN["🔓 Web login<br/>“Sign in with your key”"]
```

## The narrow waist: one substrate, many products — mail is the flagship

Five of DMTAP's capabilities turned out to be **general** — nothing about them is about mail. They form a
**narrow waist** that products beyond mail (inventory, office, CAD, and more) can adopt **à la carte**,
without reading a line of the mail spec. In this framing, **DMTAP-mail is the *first profile* built on the
waist**, not the whole protocol — it stands beside the other products, adopting all five capabilities and
adding the sealed, metadata-private message spine (§2, §5, §6) and the legacy bridge (§7) on top.

The strategy is deliberate: **monolithic messaging protocols (XMPP, Matrix) died of their mandatory
weight; tiny cores (HTTP, Nostr, AT Protocol) won by being small enough to adopt piecemeal.** The waist is
DMTAP's tiny core, pulled to the surface.

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    C1["① Identity"]; C2["② Feeds & Blobs"]; C3["③ Sync"]; C4["④ Infra Roles"]; C5["⑤ Wake"]
  end
  W --> MAIL["<b>DMTAP-mail</b> — the flagship profile<br/>§2 · §5 · §7 · §8"]
  W --> OTHER["other products<br/><i>inventory · office · CAD · …</i>"]
```

The five capabilities, and where each is specified:

| # | Capability | What it is | Substrate doc | Core home |
|---|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| ① | **Identity** | keypair = identity: Ed25519 `IK`, `DeviceCert`, `name→key` + KT, 8-word key-name floor | [`substrate/IDENTITY.md`](substrate/IDENTITY.md) | §1, §3 |
| ② | **Feeds & Blobs** | signed append-only author feeds + public content-addressed blobs, over plain HTTPS | [`substrate/FEEDS.md`](substrate/FEEDS.md) | §22 |
| ③ | **Sync** | signed multi-author CRDT op algebra + reconciliation + snapshots + sparse sync (**the one new spec**) | [`substrate/SYNC.md`](substrate/SYNC.md) | new; grounded in §5.6 |
| ④ | **Infra Roles** | open, key-addressed roles: announce/resolve, signaling, circuit relay, content-blind mailbox, cache/pin | [`substrate/ROLES.md`](substrate/ROLES.md) | §4, §14 |
| ⑤ | **Wake** | content-free, sender-blind push wake-signaling | [`substrate/ROLES.md § Wake`](substrate/ROLES.md#wake) | §4.9 |

Start at [`substrate/README.md`](substrate/README.md) for the waist model, the adoption rules (*a product
MAY adopt any subset; if it implements a capability's function it MUST speak that capability's spec*), and
the two litmus tests that keep the waist honest — the **flowstock test** (sync inventory by reading only
the waist docs) and the **HTTP test** (transports pluggable, HTTPS first-class). The substrate directory is
**additive**: it re-presents parts of §1–§24 as a standalone waist and cross-references them; it renumbers
and changes nothing in the numbered sections, which remain the normative source of truth.

## How a message moves

Messages are **sealed-sender** (intermediaries never see who sent them), **end-to-end encrypted**
(MLS/HPKE), and **signed**. The default tier routes through a **mixnet** so *who talks to whom* is
hidden from a global passive observer. Delivery is store-and-forward with durability at the edges
(the sender retries until an ack — no central queue).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant A as Alice's node
  participant M as Mesh / mixnet
  participant B as Bob's node
  A->>A: resolve bob@example.com → key (DNS + KT, cached after first contact)
  A->>A: build MOTE — sealed-sender, MLS/HPKE encrypted, signed
  A->>M: send (private tier = mixnet · fast tier = direct)
  M->>B: deliver
  B->>B: validate (cheap checks first) → decrypt → store
  B-->>A: ack  (Alice retries until this arrives)
```

## Works with the world you already have

Nobody switches to a network of zero users. DMTAP gets a real `you@provider` address on day one
and a **legacy gateway** bridges to and from ordinary email — so you can mail Gmail immediately,
and adoption is incremental, never a flag day.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  G["📮 Gmail / Outlook / any MTA<br/>(legacy SMTP)"]
  GW{{"Gateway (§7)<br/>wrap · attest · delegated DKIM"}}
  D["🕸️ DMTAP mesh"]
  G <--> GW <--> D
```

Existing clients work too — through the **gateway**, not the node. The **node is native-only**:
it speaks **JMAP** (§8.1). The **gateway** speaks the legacy protocols — **IMAP / POP3 /
SMTP-submission / CalDAV / CardDAV** — with autodiscovery, so Apple Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird,
even old iPhones configure themselves (§7.15, §8.2). A gateway must decrypt to speak legacy, so a
non-private gateway can read that mail — run your own (private mode) for zero third parties; the
native JMAP path stays zero-access (§7.15.3).

---

## What you get

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| **Sovereign identity** | A keypair *you* own; no account with any provider required to *be* an identity (§1) |
| **Reachable without a static IP** | Reached by key via the mesh; works behind CGNAT / dynamic IP (§4) |
| **End-to-end encrypted** | MLS (RFC 9420) for all sessions/groups; HPKE (RFC 9180) for sealing (§2, §5) |
| **Metadata-private** | Sealed sender + mixnet + cover traffic vs a global *passive* adversary (§6) |
| **Continuity** | Redundant, rotatable recovery; migrate your human name without losing contacts (§1.4–1.6) |
| **Legacy-compatible** | **Gateway** bridges SMTP both directions and serves legacy clients (IMAP/POP/DAV); the node stays native (JMAP) (§7, §7.15, §8) |
| **Decentralized login** | The same key signs into apps — WebAuthn-bound, key-bound sessions, OIDC bridge (§13) |
| **Post-quantum ready** | Per-object algorithm agility; PQ suites (X-Wing / ML-KEM / ML-DSA) slot in with no name change (§1) |
| **Org & domain admin** | Own `@company.com` → provision users (sovereign *or* disclosed-managed), directory, groups, roles (§3.10) |

## Built by composing standards — not inventing crypto

The novelty is the *composition and transport*, not new primitives. DMTAP profiles proven work:

| Layer | Standard |
|---|---|
| Sessions & groups | **MLS** (RFC 9420) |
| Sealing | **HPKE** (RFC 9180), X25519 · ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Signatures / hashing | **Ed25519** (RFC 8032) · **BLAKE3** |
| Wire format | Deterministic **CBOR** (RFC 8949 §4.2), COSE/CWT-style integer keys |
| Client sync (node, native) | **JMAP** (8620/8621) |
| Legacy clients (gateway only) | IMAP4rev2 (9051) · POP3 (1939) · SMTP submission (6409) · CalDAV/CardDAV |
| Mesh transport | **libp2p** (Kademlia · Circuit Relay v2 · DCUtR) |
| Metadata privacy | **Sphinx / Loopix** mix format |
| Trust / anti-equivocation | **Key Transparency** (CONIKS / IETF keytrans style) |
| Anti-abuse | **Privacy Pass** anonymous tokens (RFC 9576–9578) |
| Login | **WebAuthn** · **OAuth/OIDC** · **DPoP** (RFC 9449) · **did:web** |
| Post-quantum | **X-Wing** hybrid KEM · **ML-KEM / ML-DSA** (FIPS 203/204) |

Genuine new ground is confined to exactly two places it's actually required: the `name→key→location`
composition itself, and mesh **epoch ordering** for MLS groups (the committer, §5.1) — everything
else points at an existing spec.

## Names: one identity, many pointers

- **`name@domain`** — the everyday address (provider-issued like `you@provider.example`, or your own
  domain). Human, familiar, interoperates with legacy email.
- **the key** — the real, durable identity underneath. Names point to it; it survives name changes
  and key rotation.
- **an 8-word phrase** — a *safety number* for verifying you hold the right key (à la Signal), **not**
  an address. Easy to read aloud; carries the key's full strength.

## Repository & project

This repo is the **protocol specification** — the neutral, open standard, and the source of truth.

| Piece | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **DMTAP** | The protocol (this repo) | open standard |
| **MOTE** | The message object (signed · encrypted · content-addressed) | §2 |
| **Implementations** | Independent implementations, apps, and optional hosted operators | external — none required or endorsed here |

> DMTAP is an open standard in the way Matrix or JMAP are: implementations and hosted services
> exist around it, but none is part of the standard and none is required to speak it.

## The specification

Independent implementations MUST be buildable **from this text alone**, without reading the
reference code. Where the reference and the spec disagree, **the spec wins**. Byte-exact
[conformance vectors](conformance/) pin the wire format.

**The substrate (the narrow waist).** The [`substrate/`](substrate/) directory re-presents five general
capabilities as a small, standalone waist that products beyond mail adopt à la carte — see *The narrow
waist* above. It is **additive**: it profiles and cross-references §1–§24 without renumbering or changing
them (the numbered sections govern the normative bytes).

| File | Capability | Contents |
|------|-----------|----------|
| [`substrate/README.md`](substrate/README.md) | — | The waist model: five capabilities, adoption rules, the flowstock & HTTP litmus tests, how mail is the first profile |
| [`substrate/IDENTITY.md`](substrate/IDENTITY.md) | ① Identity | Profile of §1/§3: `IK`, `DeviceCert`, `name→key` + KT, the 8-word key-name floor, for non-mail use |
| [`substrate/FEEDS.md`](substrate/FEEDS.md) | ② Feeds & Blobs | Standalone extraction of §22 DMTAP-PUB: signed author feeds + public blobs over plain HTTPS |

| [`substrate/ROLES.md`](substrate/ROLES.md) | ④ Roles + ⑤ Wake | Infrastructure roles as an open key-addressed protocol + content-free wake (RFC 8030/8291/8292) |

**Conformance coverage (honest status).** The [`conformance/`](conformance/) catalog has **172
numbered cases** (SUITE.md ≡ suite.json). **52 are byte-runnable today** — 46 vectored cases
backed by known-answer vectors (**68 core vectors** in `vectors/vectors.json` + **15 DMTAP-PUB
vectors** in `vectors/pub_vectors.json`) plus 6 self-contained canonical-CBOR reject cases; **119
carry an exact construction recipe** and expected §21 error, pending vectors for subsystems not
yet byte-pinned (mixnet / MLS / gateway / auth and the wave-2/3 families, plus the profile-level
`CAD`/`VIDEO` checklists); and 1 is a manual-attestation case (46 + 6 + 119 + 1 = 172). Every reject
case names one of the **140 codes** in the §21 registry. So the runnable ratio is **52/172 today**,
growing as each subsystem gains a fixed-input KAT.

## Building the PDF

The spec is plain Markdown → HTML → PDF via headless Chrome, with **highlight.js** syntax
highlighting and **mermaid** diagrams (no LaTeX):

```sh
cd build
npm install       # markdown-it, highlight.js, mermaid, puppeteer-core
npm run build     # → ../dmtap.pdf
```

It drives the Chrome already on the machine (`CHROME_PATH=…` to override); nothing is fetched at
render time. Diagrams are authored inline as ` ```mermaid ` fences, so they live in the same
Markdown a reader edits. See [`build/`](build/) for the script, cover metadata, and stylesheet.

## Conventions

RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 keywords (**MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, …) apply throughout.

- **Serialization** — deterministic CBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2), integer-keyed maps; JSON only at the JMAP
  client boundary.
- **Hashing** — BLAKE3-256 for content addressing (multihash-prefixed for agility).
- **Signatures** — Ed25519 (v0); every signed structure carries a negotiable `suite` id (§1).
- **Sealing** — HPKE (RFC 9180): X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 (v0).
- **Sessions/groups** — MLS (RFC 9420); async init via MLS-native KeyPackages + external commits.
- Integers big-endian; timestamps are explicit unsigned-ms (no reliance on synchronized clocks for
  correctness — only ordering hints and expiry).

**Crypto-agility.** Unknown suites MUST be rejected, never guessed. PQ hybrids (X-Wing KEM,
ML-DSA signatures) are reserved and slot in per-object without changing any name or address.

## Honest limits (not hidden — see §6.6)

DMTAP states what it *cannot* do rather than overclaim:

- Strong metadata privacy targets a global **passive** adversary; a global **active** adversary with
  unlimited resources is bounded by the Anonymity Trilemma, not defeated.
- A first-contact MITM before key-transparency/out-of-band verification is possible; safety numbers
  and KT close it.
- Endpoint compromise is hardened (hardware-backed non-exportable keys, unlock-gated at-rest
  encryption, per-device sealing, fast revocation) down to one floor: a device **actively
  compromised while unlocked and in use** reads your plaintext (as on any system).
- The legacy-email leg is, by construction, plaintext at the far end.
- The default MLS path is signature-based (non-repudiable); an **optional deniable 1:1 mode**
  (Signal-style X3DH/PQXDH + Double Ratchet) gives cryptographic repudiation when you choose it.

## Non-goals

- **Real-time voice/video** — different architecture (WebRTC/SFU); out of scope.
- **Blockchain / token** — DMTAP uses **no** chain and **no** cryptocurrency. Self-sovereign naming
  (§3.6) is the only place an optional name-chain backend is even offered.
- **Perfect anonymity against an omnipotent active adversary** — see honest limits above.

## License

The specification is open (see the repository license). The protocol is free for anyone to
implement; no permission required.
