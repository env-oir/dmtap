# Bindings — what KOTVA adopts instead of reinventing

KOTVA "collects it all" the way a narrow waist does: it defines the thin shared core and
**binds** to existing, proven standards for everything else. A binding is a *thin mapping*
document — "how substrate identity/objects map onto this external standard" — never a
re-derivation. The rule ([DIRECTION §3](../DIRECTION.md)): specify new bytes only where
nothing exists; adopt everywhere else.

Each row is a slot. When the frontier improves, swap the binding — the substrate and profiles
never change ([DIRECTION §9](../DIRECTION.md), "future-proof by seams").

## The index

| Primitive / need | Bind to | What it gives us | Honest maturity note | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity recovery** | Account abstraction (ERC-4337, EIP-7702), passkeys, MPC (Turnkey/Privy/Web3Auth/Lit) | Kills irreversible key-loss: social recovery, passkey backup, MPC shares. ~200M smart wallets in 2026. | Solid, mainstream. Recovery finality is real; UX is web2-grade. | **adopt** |
| **Attestation** | EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service), W3C Verifiable Credentials | Signed claims about identities — "X vouches Y is licensed/over-18/KYC'd". | Plumbing is mature; the *portable-reputation* layer on top is nascent. | **adopt** |
| **Reputation** | OpenRank (EigenTrust, TEE-verified over restaking) | Sybil-resistant, context-specific reputation compute over the attestation graph. | Real; global reputation quality still depends on the personhood anchor below. | **adopt (evolving)** |
| **Proof-of-personhood** | World ID; Human Passport (ex-Gitcoin Passport, 2M+ users, secured $500M+) | The anti-Sybil anchor under reputation. | **Imperfect** — every method trades off (biometrics+operator, or passport-zk excludes the undocumented). Local scale uses web-of-trust instead. | **adopt (ceiling)** |
| **Payments / settlement** | x402 (HTTP-402 stablecoin, Coinbase+Cloudflare); USDC on Base/Solana | Money rail + micropayments + agentic payments. | Infra is real (165M+ txns); *genuine* demand still thin (~$28k/day real). | **adopt** |
| **Streaming / subscriptions** | Payment channels (Lightning/state channels), Superfluid-class streams | Recurring + streaming money over the settlement rail. | Works; recurring-pull UX still rough. | **adopt** |
| **Storage — hot** | Walrus (Sui; erasure-coded, CDN-like, ~1/5 cloud cost) | Fast retrieval for media/blobs — the Evermesh CDN answer. | Newer; behaves like a CDN, not an archive. | **adopt** |
| **Storage — permanent** | Arweave | Permanent data layer (records, provenance). | Mature for permanence. | **adopt** |
| **Storage — scale** | Filecoin (+ Storj for erasure-coded speed) | Bulk durability market. | Mature; retrieval historically slow (compose with Walrus). | **adopt** |
| **Dispute / arbitration** | Kleros-class (staked schelling-point juries) | Neutral judge for commerce/gig disputes. | Real but small/unproven at scale; re-centralizes toward pro jurors. | **adopt (ceiling)** |
| **Media transport** | WebRTC (RFC 8825 stack) | Real-time voice/video byte transport. | Mature, ubiquitous. | **adopt** |
| **Media E2E encryption** | SFrame (RFC 9605), keyed from the MLS epoch | End-to-end encrypted media → media relays are `blind`/structural. | Standardized; DMTAP §27 keys it from MLS. | **adopt** |
| **NAT-relay for media** | TURN (RFC 5766 / 8656); coturn | Media relay when direct/STUN fails — content-blind over SFrame. | Mature standard. Served by the `media-relay` role. | **adopt** |
| **Distributed SFU (scale calls)** | LiveKit (Pion) / Jitsi Videobridge + Octo / mediasoup | Multi-provider, cascaded media relay so the host isn't the size limit. | Mature open-source. Bound, not built. | **adopt** |
| **Mesh reachability** | libp2p — Circuit Relay v2, DCUtR, Kademlia, Noise, QUIC | Key-addressed reachability behind CGNAT; content-blind relay. | Mature; DMTAP §4 profiles it directly. | **adopt** |
| **Messaging crypto** | MLS (RFC 9420) | Group ratchet for 1:1, chat, files, and (via SFrame) media keys. | Standards-track, mature. | **adopt** |
| **Verifiable coordination** | TEEs (Intel SGX / AMD SEV / ARM) | Lets a coordinator hold a global view *without* seeing plaintext or being able to cheat — the `attested` assurance level. | **New trust dependency** — trades operator-trust for chip-vendor-trust; side-channel history. Disclosed, not trustless. | **adopt (disclosed)** |

## What KOTVA does **not** bind — and never will

- **A protocol token.** Money is a stablecoin; trust is *staked existing value*. No mint.
  ([DIRECTION §5](../DIRECTION.md).)
- **A global reputation *score* we compute.** Reputation is locally measured, or bound to
  OpenRank as compute — never a single authority's published number.
- **A search *ranking* token.** Search is a coordinator (indexer, TEE-preferred), not a token.
- **Surveillance-based advertising.** Rejected by design.
