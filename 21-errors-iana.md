# 21. Appendix D: Error Codes & IANA Considerations

This appendix is normative. It has two parts: **Part 1** (§21.1–§21.12) is the exhaustive
error/status registry — every failure condition defined anywhere in this specification, given a
stable code, a required responder action, and a retryability classification, so that **no
condition in DMTAP has undefined behavior**. **Part 2** (§21.13–§21.26) states the IANA
considerations: the registries DMTAP requires, their initial contents, their allocation
policies, and the procedure for extending the protocol without fragmenting it. The key words
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" are used as in RFC 2119, consistent with
the rest of this specification.

Every table entry in Part 1 is a contract: given the stated condition, the stated action is
the *only* conformant behavior. An implementation that reaches one of these conditions and does
something not listed in its Action column is non-conformant.

# Part 1 — Error / Status Registry

## 21.1 Conventions and code format

Every code is a 16-bit value `0xSSNN`: **`SS`** is the subsystem byte, **`NN`** is the code
point within that subsystem. This is a wire-level registry identifier for logging,
conformance-suite assertions (§10.3), and cross-implementation diagnostics — it is **not**
itself a new envelope field; each error is detected at the point in the spec cited in its
"Operation(s)" column, using the checks already normatively defined there. This appendix does
not introduce new validation logic; it catalogs and names the logic that §§1–17 already
require, and closes every gap where those sections left an outcome implicit.

```
0xSSNN
  SS  subsystem byte   (this appendix, §21.14)
  NN  code point       (within-subsystem, §21.14)
```

Subsystem bytes:

| `SS` | Subsystem |
|-----:|-----------|
| `0x00` | Reserved |
| `0x01` | Identity, Naming & Key Transparency (§1, §3) |
| `0x02` | Delivery & Validation — the MOTE object (§2) |
| `0x03` | Transport & Reachability — mesh, DHT, mixnet (§4) |
| `0x04` | Messaging & Group — MLS, committer (§5) |
| `0x05` | Auth — DMTAP-Auth (§13) |
| `0x06` | Gateway — legacy SMTP bridge (§7) |
| `0x07` | Anti-Abuse & Postage (§9) |
| `0x08` | Files (§5.5, §6.7) |
| `0x09`–`0xEF` | Unassigned — reserved for future subsystems (§21.25) |
| `0xF0`–`0xFE` | Private Use (experimental/vendor subsystems) |
| `0xFF` | Reserved |

Two code prefixes are used in the tables below:

- **`ERR_*`** — a rejected/failed condition: the operation did not succeed and the recipient
  took a defensive or corrective action.
- **`STATUS_*`** — a defined **non-error** outcome that still requires a specific, mandated
  responder action (e.g. deduplication). Listing these alongside errors is deliberate: a
  status the spec doesn't name explicitly is exactly where undefined behavior creeps in.

## 21.2 Responder action vocabulary (normative)

Every code in §21.3–§21.11 resolves to exactly one of the following actions. Definitions are
fixed here once so the tables can cite them tersely without re-explaining each time.

| Action | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **DROP_SILENT** | Discard immediately. No `ack`, no error returned, no user-visible effect. To the sender/network this is indistinguishable from packet loss (§2.7, §2.7a). |
| **ACK_DEDUP** | Acknowledge (`ack`) without re-processing; the object is already held (§2.6). |
| **IGNORE_NO_ACK** | Do not process (cannot validate), but do not acknowledge either — distinct from DROP_SILENT because the object may be validly formed, just unrecognized (§10.1). |
| **DEFER_REQUESTS** | Accept, but route to a "requests" holding area, rate-limited, never the inbox, never silently discarded (§2.7a). |
| **HOLD_RESYNC** | Buffer locally and initiate a resynchronization/fetch (e.g. a fresh Welcome, a fresh KT proof) before resuming normal processing; not a failure to the user. |
| **FALLBACK_LOWER_TIER** | Treat the presented proof as absent and re-evaluate under the next-weaker anti-abuse tier (token → PoW → postage → deny), never accepted on faith (§9.3.1, §9.5.1). |
| **ROTATE_RETRY** | An internal recovery action (retry via a different path, elect a new committer, re-query disjoint DHT paths) with no user-visible failure unless it is exhausted. |
| **FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK** | Refuse to proceed and refuse to silently degrade (e.g. refuse to pin, refuse to accept a suite) — the "never guess" rule (§1.1, §3.3, §10.1). |
| **HALT_ALERT** | Halt the affected group/session/identity-verification process and raise a user- or operator-visible security alert. Reserved for conditions that indicate active tampering or equivocation, not ordinary transient failure. |
| **DENY_POLICY** | Reject per a configured (recipient or operator) policy decision — a deliberate, non-adversarial deny, distinct from an abuse/security rejection. |
| **REJECT_NOTIFY** | Reject, and surface the failure to the initiating principal (sender's own client, or the RP) so it can be handled by the user — as opposed to DROP_SILENT, which is invisible to the counterpart. |
| **RETURN_SENDER_SMTP** | Gateway-specific: respond to the legacy SMTP transaction with a 4xx (transient, retry) or 5xx (permanent) code per §21.9's mapping table, so the legacy MTA's own queue is the retry mechanism (§7.2, §7.4). |
| **USER_WARN** | Do not block, but surface a non-blocking, explicit security warning to the affected user (e.g. an unchained key change) — used only where the spec explicitly permits a warn-and-continue path rather than a hard block. |

## 21.3 Identity, Naming & Key Transparency errors (`0x01xx`)

| Code | Name | Operation(s) | Meaning | Retryable | Action |
|------|------|--------------|---------|:---------:|--------|
| `0x0101` | `ERR_UNKNOWN_SUITE` | Identity/DeviceCert/RecoveryPolicy/KeyRotation/MoveRecord parse (§1.1, §10.1) | Object carries a `suite` this implementation does not recognize. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0102` | `ERR_SUITE_INTERSECTION_EMPTY` | Suite selection for delivery (§1.3) | Sender's and recipient's supported-suite sets do not intersect. | Conditional (recipient publishes an overlapping suite) | REJECT_NOTIFY |
| `0x0103` | `ERR_IDENTITY_SIG_INVALID` | `Identity` verification (§1.3) | One or more `sig` entries fail to validate under the corresponding `iks` entry. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0104` | `ERR_IDENTITY_CHAIN_BROKEN` | `Identity.prev` / `KeyRotation` / `MoveRecord` chain check (§1.3, §1.5, §1.6) | The presented object's hash chain is inconsistent with what this node has previously pinned or observed. | No | HALT_ALERT |
| `0x0105` | `ERR_STALE_ROLLBACK` | `Identity`/`RecoveryPolicy` version check (§1.3, §1.4, §3.5) | A version number ≤ a version already seen/pinned is presented (rollback/replay of a superseded-but-validly-signed object). | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK; HALT_ALERT if the target is this node's own pinned identity |
| `0x0106` | `ERR_KT_UNREACHABLE` | KT check at first contact (§3.3) | Key transparency log is unreachable, partitioned, or censored at the moment of first-contact pinning. | Yes (network condition) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — MUST NOT silently TOFU-pin; block or hard-warn and require explicit acceptance |
| `0x0107` | `ERR_KT_EQUIVOCATION` | KT tree-head gossip cross-check (§3.5) | The log shows different histories to different observers (split-view). | No | HALT_ALERT |
| `0x0108` | `ERR_KT_PROOF_INVALID` | Inclusion/consistency proof verification (§3.5) | A signed tree head or inclusion proof fails to verify against the log's public key. | Yes (fetch a fresh proof) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0109` | `ERR_NAME_RESOLUTION_FAILED` | `resolve(name)` (§3.3, §3.6) | DNS/self-sovereign name backend returns no binding, or the binding is malformed. | Yes | REJECT_NOTIFY (to the sender attempting to address this name) |
| `0x010A` | `ERR_MOVE_RECORD_INVALID` | `MoveRecord` verification (§1.6) | Signature invalid, or not chained from the pinned `IK`. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — retain the prior name binding |
| `0x010B` | `ERR_RECOVERY_POLICY_UNAUTHENTICATED` | `RecoveryPolicy` publish (§1.4 rule 1) | Not signed by `IK`, nor by a satisfied `rotate_threshold` quorum. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK + HALT_ALERT (owner's monitoring devices must alert) |
| `0x010C` | `ERR_RECOVERY_THRESHOLD_INVALID` | `RecoveryPolicy` publish (§1.4 rule 2) | `rotate_threshold` < `recover_threshold`. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — reject the policy object outright |
| `0x010D` | `ERR_DEVICE_CERT_INVALID` | `DeviceCert` validation (§1.2) | Signature invalid, or `caps` claimed exceed what the signing `IK`/quorum authorized. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x010E` | `ERR_RECOVERY_WEAKENING_UNQUORUMED` | `RecoveryPolicy` publish (§1.4 rule 3) | A change that removes/weakens a recovery factor is signed by `IK` alone without satisfying `rotate_threshold` (stolen-`IK` takeover defense). | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK + HALT_ALERT (owner's monitoring devices must alert) |
| `0x010F` | `ERR_RECOVERY_VETO_WINDOW` | `RecoveryPolicy` weakening effect (§1.4 rule 4, §16.8) | A factor-weakening change attempts to take effect before its 72 h veto/delay window elapses, or a non-conforming lesser-bar weakening is observed within the window. | Conditional (takes effect once the window elapses with no valid veto) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — hold until the window elapses; a `rotate_threshold`-backed veto aborts it |
| `0x0110` | `ERR_KT_STH_INCONSISTENT` | KT v1 STH gossip cross-check (§3.5.2(a),(d)) | Two validly-signed STHs of the **same** log are mutually inconsistent — equal `tree_size` but differing `root_hash`, or no valid consistency proof exists between them (append-only violation). Distinct from `0x0107` (`ERR_KT_EQUIVOCATION`, the split-view *conclusion*): `0x0110` is the specific append-only/consistency-proof failure that evidences it. | No | HALT_ALERT — stop trusting the log; publish the conflicting STHs as transferable evidence (§3.5.2(d)) |
| `0x0111` | `ERR_KT_LOG_QUORUM_UNMET` | KT v1 multi-log federation binding check (§3.5.2(b)) | A `name → ik` binding is not attested by the required `> n/2` quorum of the pinned log set (logs disagree, or too many are unreachable). | Conditional (a later fetch reaching quorum resolves it) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — MUST NOT pin on a sub-quorum view; fall back to OOB verification (§3.4.1) |
| `0x0112` | `ERR_KT_STH_STALE` | KT v1 STH freshness check (§3.5.2(a), §16.2) | A presented STH is older than the STH freshness window / not refreshed within the maximum merge delay — the freeze/withholding attack, where a log serves an old but self-consistent head. | Yes (fetch a fresher head) | HOLD_RESYNC — buffer and re-fetch a current STH before trusting the view; escalate to HALT_ALERT if it persists past gossip cross-check |
| `0x0113` | `ERR_DOMAIN_DIRECTORY_SIG_INVALID` | `DomainDirectory` verification (§3.10.3, §18.4.7) | The org directory object is not validly signed by the domain's pinned authority key (§3.10.1). | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — do not trust the directory; per-name resolution (§3.3) is unaffected |
| `0x0114` | `ERR_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_UNVERIFIED` | `DirEntry` forward-binding check (§3.10.3, §3.9.4) | A directory entry's `name → ik` does not match the forward DNS + KT binding — the directory indexes, it does not attest. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — render the entry unverified; MUST NOT be used to address mail |
| `0x0115` | `ERR_ORG_MANAGED_UNDISCLOSED` | Member-custody disclosure check (§3.10.2, §18.4.7) | An org-managed (escrowed-key) account is presented without its `org-managed` custody marker — undisclosed org access to a member's mailbox. | No | HALT_ALERT — MUST NOT present as a sovereign identity; surface the escrow honestly |
| `0x0116` | `ERR_DEVICE_ATTESTATION_INVALID` | `DeviceCert` hardware-attestation check (§1.2a, §18.4.2) | A context that **requires** a hardware-backed, non-exportable device key finds the `DeviceCert`'s `key_protection`/`attestation` absent or failing to verify against the platform attestation root. Advisory hardening only — never overrides the §1.4 authorization authority. | Conditional (re-enroll on an attested keystore) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — reject the device for the attestation-gated context; a non-gated context is unaffected |
| `0x0117` | `ERR_KT_LEAF_HASH_MISMATCH` | KT inclusion-proof leaf check (§3.5, §18.4.9, §18.4.10) | The leaf a KT `InclusionProof` commits to does not equal the leaf hash recomputed by the Identity-entry rule (`0x1e ‖ BLAKE3-256(0x00 ‖ det_cbor([name, ik, version, identity_id]))`) — the log presents a binding whose leaf does not match the resolved identity. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — the log indexes, it does not redefine; MUST NOT pin on the mismatched leaf (escalate to HALT_ALERT if it evidences equivocation, §3.5.2(d)) |
| `0x0118` | `ERR_DEVICE_ATTESTATION_EXPIRED` | `DeviceCert` attestation-freshness check (§1.2a, §18.4.2, §16.9) | An attestation-gated context finds the `DeviceCert.attestation` evidence older than the re-attestation cadence (≤ 90 days), past its own validity window, or chaining only to a **retired** attestation root. Advisory hardening only — never overrides the §1.4 authorization authority. | Conditional (re-attest over the same non-exportable key under a current root) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — reject for the attestation-gated context until re-attested; a non-gated context is unaffected |

## 21.4 Delivery & Validation — the MOTE object (`0x02xx`)

This table is the authoritative disposition for **every** step of the §2.7 validation order.
Codes are listed in the same order as the steps they correspond to.

| Code | Name | Operation(s) | Meaning | Retryable | Action |
|------|------|--------------|---------|:---------:|--------|
| `0x0201` | `ERR_UNKNOWN_VERSION_OR_SUITE` | §2.7 step 1 | Envelope `v` or `suite` unrecognized. | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x0202` | `ERR_BAD_CONTENT_ADDRESS` | §2.7 step 2 | `id` does not match the content address of `ciphertext`. | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x0203` | `ERR_BAD_SENDER_SIG` | §2.7 step 3 | `sender_sig` fails to verify over `(id‖to‖ts‖kind‖challenge)`. | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x0204` | `ERR_UNRESOLVED_TO` | §2.7 step 4 | `to` (DeliveryTag) does not resolve to this node or a group it belongs to. | Conditional (a later group-membership change may resolve it) | DROP_SILENT — the originating sender's own delivery state machine (§2.6, §4.7) governs retry, independent of this node |
| `0x0205` | `ERR_CHALLENGE_INVALID_FORGED` | §2.7 step 6, §2.7a | Cold-sender `challenge` is cryptographically invalid or forged. | No | DROP_SILENT — no `ack` |
| `0x0206` | `ERR_CHALLENGE_ABSENT_INSUFFICIENT` | §2.7 step 6, §2.7a | Cold-sender `challenge` is absent or below the recipient's policy threshold. Canonical disposition detailed in §21.10 (`0x0701`/`0x0702`). | Yes (resend with a sufficient challenge) | DEFER_REQUESTS |
| `0x0207` | `ERR_DECRYPT_FAILURE` | §2.7 step 7 | `ciphertext` fails to decrypt under the resolved MLS epoch key or HPKE recipient key. | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x0208` | `ERR_PAYLOAD_SIG_INVALID` | §2.7 step 8 | `Payload.sig` fails to verify under `Payload.from`. | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x0209` | `ERR_FROM_PIN_MISMATCH` | §2.7 step 8, §3.4 | Decrypted `from` does not match the pinned identity for a known contact. | No | HALT_ALERT — surface a security warning; MUST NOT silently repin |
| `0x020A` | `ERR_KIND_UNKNOWN` | §2.3, §10.1 | `kind` is outside the implemented set and not a recognized extension. | No (per this MOTE) | IGNORE_NO_ACK |
| `0x020B` | `ERR_EXPIRED_MOTE` | `Payload.expires` (§2.4, §16.1) | Client-requested expiry has passed at receipt time. | No | DROP_SILENT — cooperative hint only (§6.6 item 8), not a security guarantee |
| `0x020C` | `ERR_TIMESTAMP_OUT_OF_SKEW` | `Envelope.ts` vs. receiver clock (§16.1) | `ts` falls outside the ±120 s clock-skew tolerance. | Yes (resend with a fresh `ts`) | DROP_SILENT for cold senders; implementations MAY be lenient toward known contacts |
| `0x020D` | `ERR_MALFORMED_OBJECT` | any CBOR parse (Envelope/Payload/Attachment/Manifest) | Object fails to parse as well-formed CBOR against its schema. | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x020E` | `STATUS_DUPLICATE_ID` | §2.6 (deduplication) | Recipient already holds `id`. | N/A | ACK_DEDUP |
| `0x020F` | `ERR_SUITE_DOWNGRADE` | §2.7 step 8, §1.3 (suite ratchet) | `Envelope.suite` is **below** the sender-contact's pinned suite high-water-mark — a downgrade attempt (e.g. a broken classical suite offered after both parties migrated to PQ). | No | DEFER_REQUESTS + USER_WARN — route to requests with a security warning; MUST NOT accept the downgraded MOTE, MUST NOT ratchet the high-water-mark down |
| `0x0210` | `ERR_HYBRID_SUITE_INCOMPLETE` | §1.3 (hybrid composition), §16.7 | A hybrid-suite object (`0x02`) presented to a verifier that **supports** the hybrid suite validates on only **one** component (e.g. Ed25519 passes but the ML-DSA-65 component is absent/fails) — an intra-suite strip of the PQ half. A hybrid verifier MUST require **all** component signatures (AND-composition) and the X-Wing IND-CCA KEM combiner; single-component acceptance is for a genuinely legacy (single-component) verifier only, at that component's lower assurance. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — reject the incomplete/downgraded hybrid; MUST NOT accept it on the classical half |

**Content-addressed dedup as replay defense.** §2.6/§20E's dedup-by-`id` is what makes a bare
resend of a previously-processed MOTE a non-event rather than a distinct "replay" failure mode
at this layer — the content address absorbs it structurally. Replay of a **nonce** (as opposed
to a MOTE) is a distinct concept scoped to the Auth ceremony; see `0x0502` (§21.7).

## 21.5 Transport & Reachability errors (`0x03xx`)

| Code | Name | Operation(s) | Meaning | Retryable | Action |
|------|------|--------------|---------|:---------:|--------|

| `0x0302` | `ERR_LOCATION_STALE` | `LocationRecord` sequence check (§4.2) | Sequence number ≤ a previously-seen record for this key (rollback/censorship defense). | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — retain the newer cached record |
| `0x0303` | `ERR_LOCATION_UNREACHABLE` | DHT lookup (§4.2, §4.3) | No location record found, or no peer can be dialed via any resolved address. | Yes | ROTATE_RETRY — fall down the reachability ladder (§4.3); ultimately governed by the sender's delivery state machine (§4.7) |
| `0x0304` | `ERR_ECLIPSE_SUSPECTED` | S/Kademlia disjoint-path lookup comparison (§4.2 CAUTION) | Disjoint lookup paths disagree beyond tolerance, suggesting routing-table poisoning. | Yes | ROTATE_RETRY (re-query via disjoint paths / rendezvous); HALT_ALERT if persistent across attempts |
| `0x0305` | `ERR_RELAY_RESERVATION_UNAVAILABLE` | Circuit-relay v2 reservation (§14.5, §16.6) | Target relay has no free reservation slot. | Yes | ROTATE_RETRY — try an alternate relay |
| `0x0306` | `ERR_RELAY_CIRCUIT_CAP_EXCEEDED` | Circuit-relay v2 per-circuit cap (§16.6: 2 min / 128 KiB) | Circuit closed after hitting its duration/byte cap. | Yes | REJECT_NOTIFY — fall back to direct/hole-punch or another relay |
| `0x0307` | `ERR_MIX_PACKET_MALFORMED` | Sphinx onion peel (§4.4) | A mix hop cannot peel a layer (corrupt or non-conformant packet). | No | DROP_SILENT — a content-blind mix has no channel to notify anyone |
| `0x0308` | `ERR_SENDER_RETRY_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Delivery state machine `EXPIRED` (§2.6, §4.7, §16.1: 72 h) | Sender's retry deadline elapsed without an `ack`. | No | REJECT_NOTIFY — notify the sending user; drop the queued MOTE |
| `0x0309` | `ERR_OFFLINE_BUFFER_UNAVAILABLE` | Peer buffering / relay-mailbox pickup (§4.3, §14.5) | The buffering peer or relay-mailbox is unreachable, or the buffer's TTL has elapsed. | Yes, until TTL | ROTATE_RETRY before TTL; REJECT_NOTIFY after |
| `0x030A` | `ERR_CAPABILITY_ANNOUNCE_ROLLBACK` | `system`-MOTE capability announcement version check (§10.2) | A capability announcement's `caps_version` is older-than-or-equal-to the last accepted from that peer — a stale replay attempting to suppress an advertised capability (downgrade). | No (this announcement) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — retain the higher-versioned capability set; do not roll back |
| `0x030B` | `ERR_MIX_DIRECTORY_SIG_INVALID` | `MixDirectory` verification (§4.4.2, §18.5.3) | The mix directory is not validly signed by the pinned directory authority (or fails the `> n/2` authority quorum). | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — do not use the fleet; a KT split view over the directory is `0x0107` |
| `0x030C` | `ERR_MIX_DESCRIPTOR_STALE` | Sphinx path build / mix key epoch check (§4.4.4, §18.5.2) | A `MixNodeDescriptor` has no key for a usable epoch, or a packet was built to an expired/rotated mix key (`valid_until` passed). | Yes (refresh the `MixDirectory` and rebuild for the current epoch) | ROTATE_RETRY — re-fetch the directory, rebuild the path for the current epoch |
| `0x030D` | `ERR_MIX_PATH_UNBUILDABLE` | Stratified path selection (§4.4.3) | Cannot build a conformant 3-hop stratified path — a layer has no live/reachable mix in the current directory. | Yes (later directory epoch may repopulate) | ROTATE_RETRY; REJECT_NOTIFY once the sender's retry budget (§4.7) is exhausted |
| `0x030E` | `ERR_MIX_REPLAY_DETECTED` | Per-epoch mix replay cache (§4.4.6) | A mix received a Sphinx packet whose per-hop tag is already in its current-epoch replay cache — a replayed packet (correlation / n−1 replay attempt). | No | DROP_SILENT — a content-blind mix has no channel to notify; the duplicate is simply dropped |
| `0x030F` | `ERR_MIX_ACTIVE_ATTACK_SUSPECTED` | Loop-cover detection (§4.4.7) | A node's loop-cover return fraction fell below the loss threshold (or latency inflated beyond the delay budget), inferring an active drop/delay/flooding attack on its paths. | Yes (after rotation) | HALT_ALERT — rotate away from implicated mixes/guards, alert the user, and **fail closed for `private`** (MUST NOT auto-downgrade to `fast`, §4.4.9) |
| `0x0310` | `ERR_PRIVATE_TIER_DOWNGRADE_REFUSED` | Minimum-viable-path check (§4.4.9) | No path meeting the **in-force profile's** bar is buildable (Standard: ≥ 3 hops, 1/layer, ≥ 3 disjoint operators; **High-security: ≥ 5 hops, ≥ 5 disjoint operators**), all current-epoch keys — an adversary DoSing mixes to force a downgrade, or genuine outage. **Covers both a tier downgrade (`private → fast`) and a profile downgrade (High-security → Standard):** a high-security message that can only build a lesser-bar path fails here rather than silently shipping over Standard strength. | Yes (hold + retry until a viable path exists) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — hold the MOTE in the sender queue (§4.7), never silently route it over `fast`, a shorter/non-diverse path, or a lower profile's bar; surface to the user if it persists past the retry deadline |
| `0x0311` | `ERR_MIX_DIRECTORY_STALE` | `MixDirectory` freshness check (§4.4.2, §16.3) | The served mix directory is older than the mix-directory freshness window (≤ one mix-key epoch) — a stale, possibly frozen fleet view an adversary serves to keep the client's diversity/anonymity set small (freeze attack, analogue of KT STH-freshness `0x0112`). | Yes (re-fetch a fresh directory) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — refresh before building any `private` path; hold + fail closed (§4.4.9) if no fresh directory is obtainable, never build over the stale view |

## 21.6 Messaging & Group errors — MLS (`0x04xx`)

| Code | Name | Operation(s) | Meaning | Retryable | Action |
|------|------|--------------|---------|:---------:|--------|
| `0x0401` | `ERR_MLS_CIPHERSUITE_UNSUPPORTED` | KeyPackage/GroupInfo intake (§5.1) | Advertised MLS ciphersuite is not in this implementation's supported set. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0402` | `ERR_KEYPACKAGE_INVALID_OR_EXHAUSTED` | Async join / Add (§5.3) | KeyPackage fails signature verification, or the identity's KeyPackage bundle is exhausted. | Yes (fetch a freshly replenished KeyPackage) | REJECT_NOTIFY |
| `0x0403` | `ERR_COMMIT_ORDERING_VIOLATION` | Committer-log application (§5.1) | A Commit is received out of the committer's hash-chained log order. | Yes | HOLD_RESYNC — re-fetch the log head before applying |
| `0x0404` | `ERR_COMMITTER_FORK_DETECTED` | Committer-log integrity check (§5.1) | Two Commits occupy the same log position with the same predecessor — proof of committer misbehavior. | No | HALT_ALERT — members MUST halt and alert, analogous to KT equivocation (`0x0107`) |
| `0x0405` | `ERR_COMMITTER_UNREACHABLE` | Committer liveness (§5.1) | The group committer has not been reachable past the rotation timeout. | Yes | ROTATE_RETRY — hold pending Proposals, then elect a new committer via a Commit referencing the last agreed log head |
| `0x0406` | `ERR_EPOCH_MISMATCH` | `Envelope.epoch` resolution (§2.2, §5) | The referenced MLS epoch is unknown or superseded at this member. | Yes | HOLD_RESYNC — request a Welcome/state resync |

| `0x0408` | `ERR_EXTERNAL_COMMIT_REJECTED` | Self-join via External Commit (§5.3) | `GroupInfo` referenced by the External Commit is stale or invalid. | Yes | REJECT_NOTIFY |
| `0x0409` | `ERR_GROUP_POLICY_VIOLATION` | Add/Remove/role/policy Commit (§5.8.2) | The proposing member's role does not satisfy the required `admin`/`owner` authorization for the requested change. | No, without a role change | DENY_POLICY |
| `0x040A` | `ERR_TREEKEM_STATE_DIVERGENCE` | Post-Commit ratchet-tree integrity check (§5.1) | A member's derived tree/epoch secret disagrees with the group's expected state after applying an agreed Commit sequence. | Yes (resync from Welcome/External Commit) | HALT_ALERT — treated as a potential integrity failure, not silently reconciled |
| `0x040B` | `ERR_DENIABLE_PREKEY_INVALID_OR_EXHAUSTED` | Deniable-mode prekey intake (§5.2.1, §18.4.8) | A `DeniablePrekeyBundle`'s `sig`/`spk_sig` fails to verify, or the identity's bundle is exhausted (no unspent one-time prekey and last-resort rate-limited out). | Yes (fetch a replenished bundle) | REJECT_NOTIFY — surface to the initiating client; fall back to non-deniable MLS 1:1 only with user consent (§5.2.1(d)) |
| `0x040C` | `ERR_DENIABLE_X3DH_FAILED` | Deniable-mode key agreement (§5.2.1(a)) | X3DH/PQXDH shared-secret derivation failed — an unknown/expired `spk_ref`/`opk_ref`/`kem_ref`, or a KEM decapsulation mismatch. | Yes (re-initiate with current prekeys) | REJECT_NOTIFY |
| `0x040D` | `ERR_DENIABLE_RATCHET_AUTH_FAILED` | Double-Ratchet message auth (§5.2.1(b), §18.9.10) | A `DeniableMessage` AEAD tag (the shared-key MAC) fails to verify, or the message is irrecoverably out of ratchet order (beyond MAX_SKIP, §16.9). | No (this message) | DROP_SILENT — a MAC failure reveals nothing to notify; skipped-key exhaustion holds for resync |
| `0x040E` | `ERR_DENIABLE_MODE_UNAVAILABLE` | Deniable-mode capability check (§5.2.1(d), §10.2) | The recipient has not advertised the `deniable-1:1` capability token, so a deniable session cannot be established. | Conditional (recipient may advertise it later) | REJECT_NOTIFY — the client MUST surface the choice (send non-deniable, or not at all); MUST NOT silently downgrade the user's expectation of deniability |
| `0x040F` | `ERR_DENIABLE_SIGNATURE_PRESENT` | `DeniablePayload` decode (§5.2.1(c), §18.3.10) | A `DeniablePayload` carries a signature field — its presence would make the transcript attributable and defeat the mode's whole purpose. | No | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — reject the message; the deniable payload MUST be MAC-authenticated only, never signed |

## 21.7 Auth errors — DMTAP-Auth (`0x05xx`)

| Code | Name | Operation(s) | Meaning | Retryable | Action |
|------|------|--------------|---------|:---------:|--------|

| `0x050B` | `ERR_CAPABILITY_REVOKED` | Delegated-capability invocation vs. revocation check (§13.5, §13.5.1, §18.7.3) | A structurally-valid `CapabilityToken` (or a chain ancestor) is covered by a published `CapabilityRevocation` from its issuer or an ancestor issuer — the capability was explicitly revoked. Distinct from `0x0508` (`ERR_CAPABILITY_DELEGATION_INVALID`, the token being malformed/expired/over-attenuated): `0x050B` is a *validly-formed but revoked* grant. | No | DENY_POLICY — deny the invocation; the delegatee must be re-granted. The revocation is KT-logged and owner-visible (§13.5) |

## 21.8 Gateway errors (`0x06xx`)

| Code | Name | Operation(s) | Meaning | Retryable | Action |
|------|------|--------------|---------|:---------:|--------|
| `0x0601` | `ERR_GATEWAY_ATTESTATION_INVALID` | Inbound `GatewayAttestation` verification (§7.2a, §18.3.11, §18.9.11; at `deliver` step 8a, §19.3.1) | The `GatewayAttestation` fails to verify: its signature over "received via gateway G at T" does not verify, `msg_digest` does not match the wrapped message bytes, or the `disc` is an unknown attestation kind. | No | DROP_SILENT at the recipient node (see honest limit, §21.9) |
| `0x0602` | `ERR_GATEWAY_ATTESTATION_KEY_UNTRUSTED` | Inbound attestation key lookup (§7.2a, §18.3.11) | The attestation key (`<selector>._dmtap-gw.<domain>`) is not published under the recipient's own domain's `_dmtap-gw` record, nor in an explicitly trusted set (incl. a chained entry under an untrusted `domain`, §7.8.3). | No | DROP_SILENT |
| `0x0603` | `ERR_DKIM_DELEGATION_INVALID` | Outbound DKIM verification at destination MTA (§7.3) | The gateway's delegated-selector DKIM signature fails to verify at the receiving legacy system. | Yes (fix key publication) | REJECT_NOTIFY — the sending node's queue retries per §7.4 |
| `0x0604` | `ERR_MX_TRANSIENT_FAILURE` | Outbound SMTP transaction (§7.3) | The destination MX rejects or times out the transaction transiently. | Yes | REJECT_NOTIFY — the sending node retries; the gateway holds nothing (§7.4) |

### 21.8.1 Honest limit on `0x0601`/`0x0602`

Because the gateway is stateless and holds no queue (§7.4), and the attestation is checked by
the **recipient** after mesh delivery (potentially long after the inbound SMTP transaction has
completed), there is **no live channel back to the original legacy sender** when an attestation
fails post-delivery. This is a disclosed limit, not an oversight: the recipient's DROP_SILENT
is the correct action (never surface an unverified legacy-origin message as though it were
authenticated), but it cannot retroactively bounce the SMTP transaction that already closed.
Operators SHOULD treat repeated `0x0601`/`0x0602` from the same purported gateway as a
reputation signal (§7.5, §9.6).

## 21.9 SMTP response-code mapping (inbound, informative reference to RFC 5321 / RFC 3463)

The gateway's inbound leg (§7.2) is an ordinary SMTP transaction and MUST respond using
standard SMTP reply codes plus RFC 3463 enhanced status codes, so unmodified legacy MTAs
retry/bounce correctly. This table is not a new DMTAP registry — it maps DMTAP-level
conditions onto the existing IANA "SMTP Enhanced Status Codes" registry.

| DMTAP condition | SMTP reply | Enhanced status | Retry semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recipient key/node unresolvable within the inbound transaction window | `451` | `4.4.1` | Transient — legacy sender's MTA retries per its own queue policy. |
| Recipient reachable but has **not durably `ack`ed** within the transaction window (best-effort buffer only, no durable custody) | `451` | `4.4.1` | Transient — the gateway MUST NOT reply `250` before a durable `ack` (§19.7.1 step 6); replying `451` keeps durability in the legacy sender's queue and prevents an un-notified post-`250` loss. |
| No `name → key` binding exists for the recipient at all | `550` | `5.1.1` | Permanent — no such user. |
| Pre-`DATA` anti-abuse reject: RBL/DNSBL, SPF/DMARC hard fail (§9, §7.2 step 2) | `550` | `5.7.1` | Permanent — delivery refused on policy grounds. |
| Pre-`DATA` greylisting / rate-limit (§7.2 step 2) | `450` | `4.7.1` | Transient — try again later. |
| Message exceeds size policy | `552` | `5.3.4` | Permanent. |
| Recipient node reachable but declines (recipient-side `Policy.block`, §9.2) | `550` | `5.1.1` | Permanent. **MUST use the identical code+enhanced status as "no such user" above** (`550 5.1.1`), so a blocked sender cannot distinguish a block from a non-existent address — closing the block-membership oracle. A distinct `5.7.x` here would itself leak that the recipient exists and has blocked this sender; the block is enforced downstream and never surfaced as its own SMTP signal. |

### 21.9.1 Why a stateless gateway defers rather than accepting-then-losing (DSN safety)

A store-and-forward MTA that returns `250` becomes responsible for the message and emits a **DSN
(bounce)** if it later fails to deliver. A DMTAP gateway holds **no queue** (§7.4), so it cannot
emit a later DSN — its only signal to the legacy sender is the live SMTP reply. Therefore the
gateway returns `250` **only after the recipient node durably `ack`s** (§19.7.1 step 6); until
then it replies `451` so the **legacy sender's own MTA** retains the message and will itself
bounce after its retry window. This deliberately keeps the accept/bounce responsibility on the
one party that can still act on it, and eliminates the otherwise-silent loss where a `250` is
followed by a mesh-side `EXPIRED` (§19.3.3) with no channel left to notify the sender. (Contrast
§21.8.1: a *post-delivery* attestation failure genuinely has no live channel back — there the
loss window is disclosed and irreducible; here it is fully closed by never `250`-ing early.)

# Part 2 — IANA Considerations

## 21.13 Overview and policy vocabulary

DMTAP intends to pursue IETF standardization (§10.5). Upon submission of the governing
Internet-Draft, the registries below SHOULD be requested from IANA under "DMTAP Parameters."
Until then, **this appendix is the interim authoritative registry**, maintained per the
extension procedure in §21.25. Allocation policies use the standard terms of RFC 8126:

- **Standards Action** — requires a new RFC on the standards track.
- **Specification Required** — requires a stable, publicly available specification and review
  by a Designated Expert (§21.25), but not a new RFC.
- **First Come First Served (FCFS)** — no review; allocated on request.
- **Private Use** — not registered at all; meaningful only within a closed deployment or as a
  vendor extension, and MUST be namespaced (e.g. `x-` prefix) to avoid accidental collision.

## 21.14 DMTAP Error/Status Code Registry

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Error/Status Codes |
| **Reference** | §21.1–§21.11 (this document) |
| **Allocation policy** | New subsystem byte (`0x09`–`0xEF`): Standards Action. New code point within an existing subsystem (`NN` = `0x01`–`0x7F`): Specification Required. `NN` = `0x80`–`0xFE` within any subsystem: Private Use (implementation-local diagnostics; MUST map to the nearest standard code's Responder Action, §21.2, for any behavior visible to another implementation). `SS`/`NN` = `0x00` or `0xFF`: Reserved. |
| **Initial contents** | The 109 codes enumerated in §21.3–§21.11. |
| **Registry discipline** | Append-only. A retired code MUST be marked Deprecated, never deleted or reassigned to a different meaning (mirroring the append-only philosophy of the KT log, §3.5). |

## 21.15 Algorithm Suites Registry (`suite` u8)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Algorithm Suites |
| **Reference** | §1.1, §16.7 |
| **Allocation policy** | `0x01`–`0x1F`: Standards Action (a suite changes the network's core interoperability and security floor — every conforming node must be able to reject or accept it correctly). `0x20`–`0xDF`: Specification Required. `0xE0`–`0xFE`: Private Use. `0x00`, `0xFF`: Reserved. |
| **Initial contents** | `0x01` (Ed25519 / X25519-HPKE / ChaCha20-Poly1305 / BLAKE3-256, v0 REQUIRED); `0x02` (Ed25519+ML-DSA-65 / X-Wing hybrid / ChaCha20-Poly1305 / BLAKE3-256, PQ target). |
| **Registration requirements** | A new suite registration MUST specify: signature scheme, KEM/PKE, AEAD, hash function, and a security analysis of the combination; MUST state its MLS-ciphersuite mapping if it is to be usable for group messaging (§5.1); MUST NOT be accepted by any conformant node until published here (unknown suites are rejected fail-closed, §1.1, §10.1 — there is no silent negotiation fallback beyond the documented suite-intersection rule, §1.3). |

## 21.16 Message Kinds Registry (`kind` u8)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Message Kinds |
| **Reference** | §2.3, §10.1 |
| **Allocation policy** | `0x00`–`0x0B`: assigned (below). `0x0C`–`0x3F`: Unassigned — Standards Action (reserved for future *core* kinds sharing the wire-format guarantees of the initial set). `0x40`–`0x7F`: Specification Required (the extension range named in §2.3/§10.1). `0x80`–`0xFE`: Private Use. `0xFF`: Reserved. |
| **Initial contents** | `0x00 mail`, `0x01 chat`, `0x02 reaction`, `0x03 edit`, `0x04 redact`, `0x05 file_offer`, `0x06 group_event`, `0x07 receipt`, `0x08 presence`, `0x09 identity`, `0x0A system`, `0x0B deniable` (deniable 1:1 transport frame carrying a `DeniableFrame`, §5.2.1; the real content kind rides inside the `DeniablePayload`, §18.3.10). |
| **Forward-compatibility rule** | A node MUST NOT `ack` a `kind` it cannot validate, whether unassigned or merely unimplemented (§10.1, `0x020A`). It MAY ignore such a MOTE without error. This is the single rule that lets new kinds roll out without a flag day. |

## 21.17 Challenge Types Registry

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Anti-Abuse Challenge Types |
| **Reference** | §9.2 (`ChallengeSpec`), §2.2b |
| **Allocation policy** | Initial four types: assigned. Additional types: Specification Required — a new challenge type MUST specify its verification procedure (verifiable without decrypting the payload, per §2.2b), its issuer-trust model (per the §9.3.1 zero-default-budget rule, so a new type cannot bypass "cost for cold contact"), and its interaction with the §2.7a disposition (invalid/forged vs. absent/insufficient). `0x40`–`0xFE` (if a numeric tag encoding is used): Private Use. |
| **Initial contents** | `pow(bits)` (§9.4); `token(issuer)` — ARC-style anonymous rate-limited credential (§9.3); `stamp(amount)` — postage (§9.5); `vouch(guardianSet)` (§9.7). |

## 21.18 Name Backends Registry

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Name Backends |
| **Reference** | §3.1, §3.6, §3.9.2 |
| **Allocation policy** | Specification Required. A new backend MUST specify how it maps `name → ik` such that only `IK` can update the binding, and MUST state whether/how it composes with key transparency (§3.5) and with resolution order (§3.3). |
| **Initial contents** | `dns` (the default backend, §3.2 — TXT/SVCB records); `name-chain` (self-sovereign, un-seizable naming, §3.6 — the one place a blockchain is admitted, confined to this layer); `directory` (the opt-in flat `@handle` registry, §3.9.2, itself KT-audited). |
| **Note** | Onboarding Tiers A/B/C (§3.8) are deployment postures over the `dns` backend, not separate backends, and are not separately registered here. |

## 21.19 KT Log Identification Registry

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Key-Transparency Log Types |
| **Reference** | §3.5, DNS `kt=` parameter (§3.2) |
| **Allocation policy** | Specification Required. A log identifies itself by its own signing key and a **log-type tag** from this registry (no central log-ID authority is needed beyond the tag identifying *how to speak to* the log — the log's identity is its key, consistent with the rest of DMTAP). |
| **Initial contents** | `0x01` — **v0-minimal** (§3.5.1, the interoperable Core default): a single append-only Merkle log; signed tree heads (STHs); inclusion proofs; rollback defense (§3.3 step 2); owner self-monitoring (STH poll, §16.2); **no gossip and no federation** — tamper-evident and self-monitorable, but *not* equivocation-proof (§6.6 item 6). `0x02` — **v1-hardening** (§3.5.2, capability-negotiated per §10.2, **not** the default): a **federated set of independent, per-key append-only logs**, each publishing STHs at least every maximum merge delay (§16.2). A verifier pins a *set* and accepts a `name → ik` binding only on a **`> n/2` quorum** of that set (§3.5.2(b), mirroring the §5.1/§16.8 roster quorum), so no single log is authoritative. Verifiers, **monitors** (per-identity), and **auditors** (per-log) **gossip STHs** and cross-check **consistency proofs** (§3.5.2(a),(c)); a split view / append-only violation / stale-frozen head is detected and produces `ERR_KT_EQUIVOCATION` (`0x0107`), `ERR_KT_STH_INCONSISTENT` (`0x0110`), `ERR_KT_LOG_QUORUM_UNMET` (`0x0111`), or `ERR_KT_STH_STALE` (`0x0112`), with the mandated HALT_ALERT / fail-closed response of §3.5.2(d). A verifier MUST implement `0x01` and MAY additionally negotiate `0x02`; a node offered only `0x02` by a peer that itself supports only `0x01` uses `0x01`. |
| **Registration requirements** | A new log type MUST specify its proof format (STH structure, inclusion and consistency proofs — which MUST remain independently auditable per §3.5) and MUST NOT weaken the append-only, tamper-evident guarantee that makes KT meaningful. A log type that claims equivocation resistance MUST specify its gossip and cross-checking procedure and the responder actions for a detected split view (as `0x02` does via §3.5.2). |

## 21.20 Envelope/Payload Extension Header Keys Registry (`Headers.ext`)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP `Headers.ext` Keys |
| **Reference** | §2.4 (`ext: { * tstr => any }`), §10.1 |
| **Allocation policy** | Two namespaces. **Unprefixed keys** (e.g. a future `priority`, `delegate`): Specification Required — intended for genuinely interoperable, cross-implementation semantics. **`x-`-prefixed keys**: Private Use / FCFS — no registration required, reserved for experimentation and vendor-specific metadata, and MUST NOT be assumed portable across implementations. |
| **Initial contents** | None assigned at v0. Candidate future registrations flagged by the feature-parity audit (§17.6) but **not yet registered**: a delegate-attribution marker ("sent/edited by delegate device X of identity Y," items 23/43) and a cosmetic `priority` hint (item 27) — both Specification-Required candidates for a future revision, listed here for traceability only. |
| **Forward-compatibility rule (normative)** | A receiver MUST ignore any `ext` key it does not recognize; an unrecognized key MUST NOT cause validation failure or message rejection. This is what lets `ext` be extended without breaking older clients. |

## 21.21 DNS Parameter Keys Registry (`_dmtap` / `_dmtap-gw` / `_dmtap-mix`)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP DNS TXT/SVCB Parameters |
| **Reference** | §3.2, §7.2a |
| **Allocation policy** | Specification Required. |
| **Initial contents** | Under `<name>._dmtap.<domain>` TXT: `v=` (format version), `suite=` (algorithm suite, §1.1), `ik=` (base64url identity public key), `id=` (hash of the current `Identity`, §1.3), `kt=` (KT log URL), `keypkgs=` (KeyPackage bundle locator, §5.3). Under `_dmtap.<domain>` SVCB: reserved service parameters and KT anchors. Under `<sel>._dmtap-gw.<domain>` TXT (§7.2a): `v=` (attestation scheme version), `k=` (gateway attestation public key). Under `<sel>._dmtap-mix.<domain>` TXT (§4.4.8, analogous to `_dmtap-gw`): `v=` (attestation scheme version), `k=` (mix-operator attestation public key), binding a `MixNodeDescriptor.operator` to an accountable domain for path operator-diversity (§4.4.8). Under `_dmtap.<domain>` a `mix=` locator (§4.4.2) points to the `MixDirectory` authority. |
| **Registration requirements** | A new TXT/SVCB key MUST specify its grammar and whether it is required or optional for a conformant resolver; unrecognized keys in an existing record MUST be ignored by resolvers (same forward-compat rule as §21.20). |

## 21.22 Capability Negotiation Registry (§10.2)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Capability Tokens |
| **Reference** | §10.2, `system` MOTEs (`kind = 0x0A`) |
| **Allocation policy** | Specification Required for tokens intended to be portable across implementations; `x-`-prefixed tokens are Private Use / FCFS, mirroring §21.20. |
| **Initial contents** | Supported-suite tokens (§1.1); privacy-tier tokens (`private`, `fast`, §4.6); supported MLS ciphersuite tokens (§5.1); the **`deniable-1:1`** token (advertises support for the optional deniable 1:1 mode, §5.2.1 — both peers MUST advertise it before a deniable session is established); KT log-type tokens (`0x01`/`0x02`, §3.5.2, §21.19); mix-suite tokens (§4.4.12, §21.23); transport-substrate tokens (§4.1, §21.24); supported extension-kind/extension-header tokens (cross-referencing §21.16/§21.20 registrations); and **signed-object `≥ 64` extension-field tokens** — a peer advertises support for a reserved extension field before any sender may include it in a *signed* object (§18.1.2, §10.2). |
| **Announcement versioning** | Capability announcements are **monotonic**: each carries a `caps_version` (`u64`) and a receiver rejects an announcement older-or-equal to the last accepted from that peer (`ERR_CAPABILITY_ANNOUNCE_ROLLBACK`, `0x030A`, §10.2), so a stale replay cannot suppress an advertised capability. |
| **Forward-compatibility rule** | A node receiving a capability token it does not recognize MUST ignore that token (not the whole `system` MOTE) and MUST NOT assume the counterpart lacks the capability merely because the token name is unfamiliar — absence of a recognized token (in the current, highest-`caps_version` announcement) is inconclusive, not a negative assertion. |

## 21.23 Mix Parameters Registry (Sphinx / mixnet, §4.4)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Mix Parameters |
| **Reference** | §4.4 (§4.4.1 packet format, §4.4.3 path, §4.4.4 epochs, §4.4.12 PQ), §16.3 |
| **Allocation policy** | **Mix suite** values (the `suite` on `MixNodeDescriptor`/`MixKeyEntry`, §18.5.2): `0x01`–`0x1F` Standards Action, `0x20`–`0xDF` Specification Required, `0xE0`–`0xFE` Private Use, `0x00`/`0xFF` Reserved — mirroring the Algorithm Suites registry (§21.15), because a mix packet format is a network-wide interoperability and security floor. Individual numeric parameters (path length, cell size, delay/cover means, epoch length) are **profile values fixed in §16.3**, tuned within the protocol version, not separately code-point-allocated. |
| **Initial contents** | **Mix suite `0x01` (v0 REQUIRED):** classical **Sphinx** (Danezis–Goldberg 2009) — header group **X25519**, `β` stream cipher **ChaCha20**, per-hop header MAC **Poly1305** (over `β` only), **`δ` payload wide-block PRP LIONESS** (Anderson–Biham, over the whole cell — **not** a stream cipher or AEAD; this is what gives payload tagging-resistance, §4.4.1/§4.4.6), KDF **BLAKE3**, cell payload `δ` **2 KiB**, path length **3**, stratified topology, Poisson per-hop delay (§4.4.1, §4.4.3, §16.3). **Mix suite `0x02` (RESERVED, PQ frontier):** a post-quantum / hybrid Sphinx packet format — **not yet specified**, tracked per §4.4.12 and §11.3; reserved so the agility seam (`suite` on descriptors + capability negotiation §10.2) is ready when a PQ mix format is standardized. |
| **Registration requirements** | A new mix suite MUST specify its full packet construction (group element, per-hop KDF, `β` stream cipher, `γ` header MAC, and a **`δ` payload transform that is a wide-block PRP / SPRP over the whole cell** — never a stream cipher or an AEAD-over-`δ`, since a malleable payload transform reintroduces active payload tagging — plus the constant-length invariant) and a security analysis; MUST preserve Sphinx's constant-length, unlinkable-per-hop, tagging-resistant properties (**header** integrity via `γ`, **payload** tagging-resistance via the wide-block `δ` transform); MUST state its cell size and how it composes with the bucket ladder (§4.4.1); and MUST NOT be accepted by a node until published here (unknown mix suites rejected fail-closed, mirroring §1.1). PQ mix formats MUST disclose their metadata-only exposure honestly (§4.4.12). |

## 21.24 Transport Substrates Registry (§4.1)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Registry name** | DMTAP Transport Substrates |
| **Reference** | §4.1 (substrate seam), `LocationRecord.substrate` / `MixNodeDescriptor.substrate` (§18.5.1, §18.5.2) |
| **Allocation policy** | Specification Required. A new substrate MUST specify how `peer_id` and `addrs` are interpreted and dialed under it, how it composes with the reachability ladder (§4.3) and the mixnet (§4.4), and its NAT/roaming story. `0x01`–`0xDF` Specification Required; `0xE0`–`0xFE` Private Use (closed deployments); `0x00`/`0xFF` Reserved. |
| **Initial contents** | `0x01` — **libp2p** (v0 REQUIRED, the default; absent `substrate` field ⇒ this value): Kademlia DHT routing, circuit-relay v2, Noise/TLS, QUIC/TCP/WS/WebRTC/WebTransport, PeerId = `multihash(pubkey)`, addresses = multiaddrs (§4.1–§4.3). |
| **Migration** | A new substrate is introduced **additively** and **capability-negotiated** (§10.2), the same dual-stack mechanism as a new algorithm suite (§21.15, §21.25 procedure): nodes advertise supported substrates, publish records under each, bridge during the transition, and retire the old substrate only once no pinned relationship needs it. A resolver treats a record on an unimplemented substrate as unreachable (`0x0303`), never a parse failure — moving off libp2p is an incremental migration, not a flag day. |

## 21.25 Extension & versioning procedure (normative)

This section is the operational answer to "how does DMTAP add something new without
fragmenting."

1. **New algorithm suite.** Standards Action (§21.15). A node encountering an unregistered
   `suite` value in any signed/encrypted object MUST reject it (`0x0101`/`0x0201`) — there is
   no partial trust, no best-effort parse. Suite adoption spreads only via the multi-suite
   `Identity.suites` mechanism (§1.3): a recipient advertises the new suite, senders pick up
   the intersection, and old suites are retired only once no pinned relationship requires them.

2. **New message `kind`.** Specification Required within `0x40`–`0x7F` (Standards Action for a
   `0x0B`–`0x3F` core allocation, §21.16). A node receiving an unassigned or unimplemented
   `kind` MUST NOT `ack` it (`0x020A`) and MAY silently ignore it; this is what lets a new kind
   roll out client-by-client with no coordinated flag day (§10.1).

3. **New `Headers.ext` key.** Specification Required for an unprefixed key intended to be
   portable; no registration for `x`-prefixed experimentation (§21.20). A receiver MUST ignore
   an unrecognized key rather than fail validation.

4. **New challenge type, name backend, DNS parameter, or capability token.** Specification
   Required, reviewed by a Designated Expert (below) for two things specific to DMTAP, beyond
   ordinary interoperability: (a) an anti-abuse extension MUST preserve the issuer-trust /
   zero-default-budget rule (§9.3.1) — it MUST NOT create a path for a sender to manufacture
   its own unlimited-cost-relief proof; (b) **no** extension of any kind MAY be gated behind an
   operator's paid seam in a way that weakens privacy, cryptography, or metadata protection —
   the inviolable rule of §12.3 binds extensions exactly as it binds the base protocol.

5. **Designated Expert.** Pending formal IETF adoption (§10.5), the expert function is
   performed by the specification's maintainers, applying the criteria above. Upon Internet-
   Draft submission, this function SHOULD transition to an IANA-run registry with an
   IETF-appointed Designated Expert, per standard IANA practice for Specification-Required
   registries.

6. **Deprecation, never reassignment.** Once allocated (in any registry in this appendix), a
   code point, key, or tag MUST NOT be reused for a different meaning, even if the original
   allocation is abandoned. Mark it Deprecated and allocate a new point for new semantics. This
   mirrors the append-only discipline that makes key transparency (§3.5) and the committer log
   (§5.1) trustworthy, applied to the registries themselves.

7. **Unknown-value handling — the three forward-compatibility rules, stated together.**
   Precisely because these three differ, they are restated together here to prevent
   conflation:
   - **Unknown `suite`** → **rejected**, fail-closed, no processing (`0x0101`/`0x0201`).
   - **Unknown `kind`** → **not acknowledged**, but MAY be silently ignored rather than
     rejected (`0x020A`).
   - **Unknown `ext` key** → **ignored**, and MUST NOT affect validation of the rest of the
     object at all.

   The differing treatment is deliberate: a suite is a security-critical trust decision (guess
   wrong and you silently downgrade crypto), a kind is a processing-capability question (guess
   wrong and you silently corrupt application semantics), and an `ext` key is inert metadata by
   construction (guess wrong and nothing security-relevant is at stake).

## 21.26 Summary

- **Error/status codes defined:** 109 (`0x0101`–`0x0118`: 24, incl. the KT-v1 detection codes
  `0x0110`–`0x0112`, the org-administration codes `0x0113`–`0x0115` (§3.10), `0x0116`
  device-attestation and `0x0118` attestation-expired (§1.2a), and `0x0117` KT leaf-hash mismatch
  (§3.5, §18.4.9); `0x0201`–`0x0210`: 16, incl. `0x020F` suite-downgrade and `0x0210`
  hybrid-suite-incomplete (intra-suite PQ-strip defense, §1.3);
  `0x0301`–`0x0311`: 17, incl. `0x030A` capability-announce
  rollback (§10.2) and the mixnet codes `0x030B`–`0x0311` — directory/descriptor/path (`0x030B`–`0x030D`),
  replay (`0x030E`), active-attack detection (`0x030F`), no-downgrade fail-closed covering
  both tier and profile downgrade (`0x0310`, §4.4.9), and mix-directory freshness/freeze defense
  (`0x0311`, §4.4.2);
  `0x0401`–`0x040F`: 15, incl. the deniable-mode codes `0x040B`–`0x040F` (§5.2.1) — prekey
  invalid/exhausted, X3DH/PQXDH failure, ratchet-MAC failure, mode-unavailable, and the
  signature-forbidden guard;
  `0x0501`–`0x050B`: 11, incl. `0x050B` capability-revoked (§13.5, §18.7.3); `0x0601`–`0x0604`: 4,
  plus the informative SMTP mapping table of §21.9;
  `0x0701`–`0x070E`: 14; `0x0801`–`0x0808`: 8, incl. `0x0808` manifest-key-present (§5.5)),
  spanning the 8 requested subsystems, with every code resolving to exactly one of the 13
  defined responder actions (§21.2) — no undefined behavior remains.
- **IANA registries defined:** **11 registries + 1 extension/versioning procedure** — the 8
  requested registries (Algorithm Suites, Message Kinds, Challenge Types, Name Backends, KT Log
  Types, `Headers.ext` Keys, DNS Parameters, Capability Tokens), the **Mix Parameters** registry
  (§21.23) and **Transport Substrates** registry (§21.24) added for the mixnet and substrate seams
  (§4.4, §4.1), and the DMTAP Error/Status Code Registry itself (§21.14, needed to make Part 1
  durable against future extension) = **11 registries**; plus the **extension/versioning procedure**
  (§21.25) that governs all of them — a procedure, **not** a registry. (Earlier drafts stated "12
  registries," conflating the §21.25 procedure with the registries; it is corrected here.)
