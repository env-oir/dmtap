# 12. Gateway

## 12.1 Scope

The storefront role: rendering signed objects for browsers, domains, and the trust boundary.

## 12.2 What this section will specify

- The rendering contract: what a gateway must verify before serving, and what it publishes about
  what it served.
- **Render bundles**: seller-supplied presentation, sandboxed.
- **Subdomain** allocation (single-label, one wildcard certificate) and **custom domain** binding.
- Escrow co-location: a gateway that also settles is the facilitator of §11.3.

## 12.3 Origin isolation (will be normative)

Merchant render bundles are untrusted code. **Every store must get its own origin.** A gateway
serving multiple stores from one origin lets one bundle read another store's cart and session; it
is non-conformant, not merely ill-advised.

**And this section has to say how origins are compared**, which it previously did not. Implementing
the rule surfaced the gap: a naive string comparison reports `alice.example` and `Alice.example` as
distinct origins, while DNS and every browser treat them as the same one — same storage partition,
same cart, same session. A gateway that allocated both would believe it had isolated two stores and
would in fact have handed one merchant's bundle read access to the other's data, while passing its
own conformance check.

So the comparison is normalised before it is made: ASCII-lowercased, with any trailing root label
dot removed. Internationalised names need an IDNA pass before that point, and a gateway accepting
them without one has the same hole in a less obvious form. A rule that says *what* must be true and
not *how it is tested* is a rule an implementation can satisfy on paper and violate in practice.

## 12.4 Process isolation (will be normative)

A gateway terminates untrusted connections and renders untrusted bundles. It must run as a separate
process with no access to identity keys or the object store. "One binary, several roles" never
means one address space.

## 12.5 The honest limit

DMTAP's gateway self-extinguishes as adoption grows. **TRACT's does not**, because browsers are
permanent and a shopper without a keypair cannot verify a signature. The mitigation is
**detectability, not prevention**: any node can re-render the same store from the same signed
objects and be compared byte-for-byte. A native client needs no gateway; two native parties never
need one to transact.

## 12.6 Open

- Whether the spec should define a canonical render so byte-for-byte comparison is meaningful, or
  only require that the underlying objects be exposed for independent verification.
