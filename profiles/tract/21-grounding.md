## 21.1 Coverage — read this before citing anything below

Two passes have run. Between them, **four areas produced claims that survived three-vote
adversarial verification:** deployed networks, global product identity, the goods/variant slice of
the data model, and — from the second pass (§21.10) — live commerce state.

**Still unresearched after both passes, and therefore neither supported nor refuted:** logistics
standards and consolidation optimisation (§8); privacy-preserving analytics and fraud (§13); and
the whole of trust, dispute, tax and legal (§9.6, §10, §11). The second pass targeted all three
directly and returned **nothing verified** on any of them, which makes them a standing gap rather
than an oversight.

Those gaps are **absence of evidence, not evidence of absence**, and §8, §10, §11 and §13 must not
cite this section as support. §11 in particular currently answers by assertion — who the
marketplace facilitator is when there is no marketplace operator, and how erasure rights are
satisfied against irrevocable objects, are both unanswered here. Within the covered areas, several named systems also produced nothing
verified: Particl, Origin Protocol, BOLT12, x402, L402, and ActivityPub-based commerce.

## 21.2 The finding that most threatens this design

> **There is no deployed system achieving cross-publisher product identity without a licensed
> registry, and the one candidate for a permissionless alternative was refuted.**

The two deployed models are the only two:

| Model | Property | Cost / gate |
|---|---|---|
| **GS1 GTIN** | permissioned monopoly namespace | *licensed*, not sold; issued through national member organisations; US$30 per identifier at GS1 US (verified 2026-07-21, US-specific — do not generalise). The free tier is explicitly restricted to closed/local circulation. |
| **schema.org `productGroupID`** | purely nominal | a plain `Text` string — no issuer, no registry, no uniqueness guarantee |

There is nothing in between. A claim that crawl-derived clustering over schema.org identifiers
demonstrates feasible permissionless product entity resolution was **refuted 0-3**. So this
document contains **no positive evidence that cross-publisher product deduplication works at
scale.**

**What this means for §2.** The content-address floor is sound as a *mechanism* — identical bytes
converge, trivially. It is unproven as a *solution*, because independent publishers describing the
same physical product do not produce identical bytes, and nothing here shows that the gap can be
closed adversarially. §2's canonicalisation rules are therefore the load-bearing part of that
section, not the addressing, and §2.5 must keep near-duplicate resolution listed as **open**
rather than implied-solved. Language suggesting a global product view "falls out of" content
addressing overstates what is known.

## 21.3 The OpenBazaar postmortem

OpenBazaar was the closest deployed relative of this design: signed objects, content-addressed
listings, keypair identity, no operator. It shut down in January 2021. Cite it as a postmortem,
never as a live comparison.

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Lifetime participants | ~6,651 |
| Concurrently online | ~80 |
| Credible sales, 14 months | ~US$86,000 |
| Median listing lifetime | ~22 days |
| Share of measured sales value faked by one vendor | **60%** |

Four failure modes, each of which maps onto a section of this document:

1. **Negligible economic activity** — orders of magnitude below centralized equivalents.
2. **Discovery re-centralized first.** A content-addressed substrate offers no global index, so
   search was outsourced to crawler operators, and the default one became a content-policy
   gatekeeper. → §2.6.
3. **Availability was bounded by publisher liveness.** Whole catalogues disappeared when a merchant
   node went offline; third-party indexes went stale against the live network. → §21.5.
4. **Reputation was trivially ballot-stuffed and structurally unenforceable**, and **opt-in escrow
   and moderation went unused precisely where they mattered most** — bad actors simply declined
   them. → §21.6.

*Source caveat:* all four rest on one peer-reviewed, DHS-funded measurement paper and share its
methodology. Sales figures are an author-acknowledged lower bound from voluntary feedback, and
item-survival numbers conflate deliberate delisting with liveness eviction.

## 21.4 What the largest live network chose instead

**Beckn / ONDC** is the biggest deployed "decentralized commerce" network, and it avoids
OpenBazaar's failure modes by doing the opposite of this specification:

- **Registry-mediated, not self-certifying.** Participants register keys via `POST /subscribe`;
  counterparties resolve endpoints and public keys through a registry lookup — not gossip, not a
  DHT, not content addressing.
- **Approval-gated permissioned enrollment.** Portal whitelisting (6–48h), a signed agreement,
  certification, and probation before a participant may transact.
- **Identity anchored to DNS/TLS domain names, not keypairs** — inheriting CA and DNS
  centralization on top of registry centralization.
- **Discovery through operator-hosted, rate-limited lookup endpoints**, giving the operator a
  throttle and deny lever over network-wide discovery.

**This is the honest comparison, and it is uncomfortable.** The network with volume chose an
operator at exactly the three points this document tries to leave operator-free. That is not proof
this design fails; it is evidence that the burden of proof sits here, not with them.

*Time sensitivity:* Beckn developer docs are stamped 2021; ONDC has deprecated `/lookup` and
`/vlookup` in favour of `/v2.0/lookup`, whose rate limit is published as "TBD".

## 21.5 Liveness is a first-class problem, not an edge case

§0.7 says durability lives at the edges and the sender's node retries. That is true **for orders**
and false **for catalogues**.

A seller whose node is offline is not merely slow to receive orders — they are **invisible**.
OpenBazaar's ~22-day median listing lifetime and mass catalogue disappearance on node departure are
the measured consequence. §21.1 notwithstanding, this one is directly evidenced.

**Implications this document must carry rather than bury:**

- Documentation MUST NOT imply that an intermittently-online seller is fully functional. A laptop
  that sleeps can *receive orders* through the substrate's mailbox and wake path; it cannot *serve
  a catalogue* while asleep.
- Third-party caching/pinning of public catalogue objects moves from a nice-to-have to a
  requirement for any seller not running an always-on node — and **unpaid replication is exactly
  what OpenBazaar did not get**. Whether pinning needs an incentive, and whether that incentive
  creates another operator, is open.
- A gateway serving a store is, incidentally, a liveness backstop. That is an argument *for* the
  operator class of §0.4.2, and it should be counted honestly as one.

## 21.6 Reputation: the documented failure mode is this design's

OpenBazaar's reputation failure was **self-published, unweighted reviews with no banning
authority**, combined with **opt-in escrow that bad actors declined**. One vendor faked 60% of
measured sales value.

§10 proposes purchase-attested reviews, which is strictly stronger than what OpenBazaar had — an
attestation binds a review to a transaction. But two of OpenBazaar's failure conditions survive
unchanged in this document as currently written:

1. **Self-dealing.** A seller transacting with itself produces genuine attestations. Attestation
   raises cost; it does not establish that the counterparty was independent.
2. **Opt-in escrow is declined by exactly the actors it exists to constrain.** §9.6 makes escrow
   per-order and optional, and §9.6's own reasoning — that mandatory escrow would exclude
   underserved regions — is sound. But the measured consequence of optionality is that it goes
   unused where it matters. Both cannot be true costlessly.

**§10 and §9.6 must state this rather than claiming attestation resolves it.** The sybil-cost floor
achievable on a signed-feed substrate is listed in §21.8 as an open question because the attack
literature was not reached by this pass.

## 21.7 A warning about scope

Nostr — a signed-feed ecosystem structurally similar to this substrate — marked its marketplace
specification **NIP-15 "unrecommended: too complicated"** in-repo (banner added 2026-05-31) and
redirected implementers to NIP-99, a far simpler classified-listing primitive. Neither solves "many
stores, one SKU": product IDs are merchant-generated and merchant-scoped, discovery is free-text
tags, and there is no cross-publisher product identifier.

NIP-15 also moves the entire order and checkout flow off the public feed into encrypted messages
with **the merchant as sole authority** asserting payment and shipment — no escrow, no buyer
counter-signature, no third-party-verifiable order state. This document's §7 signed-transition
model is a deliberate departure from that, and the departure is the point; but the ecosystem's own
verdict on structured-commerce complexity is a caution this specification should not ignore.

*Wording note:* the repo status word is "unrecommended", not "deprecated".

## 21.8 Open questions this pass could not close

1. **Does any deployed system achieve cross-publisher product identity without a licensed
   registry?** The design space between GS1 monopoly and nominal merchant string is currently
   evidence-free. Needs a dedicated pass on entity resolution, blocking strategies and
   probabilistic matching **under adversarial publishers** — including deliberate collision.
2. **What is the achievable sybil-cost floor for reputation on a signed-feed substrate?** Do buyer
   counter-signatures, transaction-cost binding, or local-only web-of-trust scoring actually resist
   ballot-stuffing? Entirely unresearched.
3. **Where does a spec put the operator-shaped functions it cannot eliminate — indexer, registrar,
   arbiter, pinner?** ONDC answers "one central approval-gating registry". OpenBazaar answered
   "nowhere" and got a gatekeeping default search engine plus liveness-bounded availability. **Is
   there a middle design** — multiple competing indexers with verifiable completeness or
   censorship proofs, federated or rotating registrars, paid pinning markets — **with any deployed
   precedent and measured outcomes?** This is the central unanswered question for §0.4.
4. **How do erasure rights and identifiable-seller mandates interact with immutable,
   content-addressed, replicated commerce objects?** Who is the data controller when order data is
   replicated across independent nodes; how is erasure satisfied against irrevocable objects; who
   satisfies trader-traceability duties when identity is a keypair; and who is the "marketplace
   facilitator" for tax purposes when no marketplace operator exists. **These are the most likely
   hard blockers on a no-operator design**, and §0.5.1 and §11 currently answer them by
   construction and by assertion respectively, not by evidence.

## 21.9 What this section obliges

- §2 must not imply that content addressing solves global product identity (§21.2).
- §2.6 must state that "any node MAY build an index" does not prevent one index becoming the de
  facto gatekeeper (§21.3, §21.4).
- §0.7 and all self-hosting guidance must distinguish receiving orders from serving a catalogue,
  and must not present an intermittently-online seller as fully functional (§21.5).
- §9.6 and §10 must state the opt-in-escrow and self-dealing failure modes as measured outcomes,
  not hypotheticals (§21.6).
- No section may cite this one as support for logistics, analytics, live-state or legal claims
  (§21.1).

## 21.10 Second pass — live commerce state (July 2026)

A second adversarially-verified pass covered the four areas §21.1 records as unresearched. **Only
one of them produced surviving claims: live commerce state.** Logistics and delivery, privacy-
preserving analytics and fraud, and the whole of trust/dispute/tax/legal produced **no verified
findings and remain unresearched** — §21.1's prohibition on citing this section for them still
stands, and §8, §10, §11 and §13 are still unevidenced.

### 21.10.1 The good news: no-coordinator oversell prevention is real

A seller running N replicas **can** guarantee no oversell with no coordinator. The mechanism is the
escrow/demarcation family — O'Neil (1986) → Barbará-Millá & Garcia-Molina (1994) → Balegas et al.,
SRDS 2015 (`BoundedCounter`), shipped in production as AntidoteDB's `antidote_crdt_counter_b`.

The gap between the counter and its bound is pre-partitioned into transferable **rights**. A replica
may decrement only from rights it holds locally, and the locally computed right count is always
conservative — it can under-count but never over-count. So the invariant holds **even from stale
state**, and the guarantee survives arbitrary message loss, delay, reorder and partition.

The contrast matters: a plain eventually-consistent read-check-decrement counter measurably **does**
oversell — roughly 200 excess decrements at ~200 concurrent clients in the SRDS'15 experiment. This
is not a theoretical risk being designed around.

**The guarantee is safety-only and is paid for entirely in liveness:** stranded quota, spurious
"sold out", and aborted decrements while global stock remains. §6.4 already states that residual.

### 21.10.2 The bad news: four operator-shaped roles inside the counter

Each of these must be accepted or replaced explicitly by §6. None was visible before this pass.

1. **An intra-replica serialization point is mandatory.** A single-writer node, a compare-and-swap,
   or consensus. **A "replica" therefore cannot itself be a set of mutually uncoordinated nodes** —
   the coordination is not removed, it is pushed down one level and made local.
2. **The failure model is crash-recovery with durable state, not Byzantine.** This is the sharpest
   finding in the pass. **A lying or state-losing replica simply oversells**, and none of this
   literature covers stock held across *mutually distrusting* parties. The mechanism is sound for a
   seller's own replicas, which trust each other; it says nothing about a seller who lies.
3. **Reclaiming a permanently-dead replica's rights requires an agreement or failure-detector
   decision** — and if that decision is wrong, rights are double-issued and the invariant breaks.
   Deciding a peer is dead is exactly the kind of judgement a coordinator makes.
4. **With three or more replicas, transfer is no longer anonymous.** The giver must name the
   recipient, which reintroduces an allocation policy — and the papers themselves suggest
   centralising it.

### 21.10.3 Sagas do not provide what multi-party checkout needs

Confirmed rather than assumed: sagas explicitly provide **neither atomicity nor isolation**. Other
parties observe partial sagas, and there is no abort cascade. So multi-party checkout gets eventual
amendment, never oversell prevention — **oversell prevention has to sit in the per-replica
invariant primitive**, not in the checkout flow above it. §6.4's "no cross-seller atomicity" is
therefore not a limitation to be engineered away later; it is the correct shape.

### 21.10.4 What §6 must now say

- Name the intra-replica serialization requirement rather than implying replicas need no
  coordination at any level (§21.10.2 item 1).
- State the **non-Byzantine failure model as a hard boundary**: bounded counters protect a seller
  from their own concurrency, not a buyer from a dishonest seller. Conflating the two would be a
  safety claim the literature does not support (item 2).
- Specify dead-replica right reclamation as an explicit, fallible decision with a stated failure
  mode, not a background detail (item 3).
- Acknowledge that transfer names a recipient at N ≥ 3, and say who chooses (item 4).

## 21.11 Third pass — who is the facilitator (July 2026)

A narrow pass on the five legal questions §11 answers by assertion. **One of the five produced
verified findings. The other four returned nothing across three consecutive passes** and are
unresearched, not resolved: GDPR Art 17 against immutable objects, DSA/INFORM/GPSR trader
traceability, escrow as a regulated payment service, and measured outcomes of non-custodial escrow.
Their silence is not a favourable answer.

Everything below is statutory construction and regulator guidance. **No court anywhere has applied
any of it to a permissionless no-operator protocol.** The favourable readings are textually strong
and legally untested, and that gap is the finding as much as the readings are.

### 21.11.1 The favourable finding, and exactly how far it reaches

Every representative US state marketplace-facilitator test is **conjunctive and gated on a contract
with the seller**. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6041(b) reads "a person who **contracts with** marketplace
sellers to facilitate … through a marketplace **operated by the person** … **and** who does both of
the following", and its infrastructure prong — "owning or operating the infrastructure … that
brings buyers and sellers together" — sits *inside* that contract gate. Wash. RCW 82.08.010(15)(a)
requires all three of contract, transmission of offer/acceptance, and a listed activity; the state's
own guidance says "all three main criteria must be met simultaneously".

**So a gateway no seller has contracted with falls outside the definition on its face, whatever
infrastructure it runs.** That is the strongest structural argument the no-operator design has, and
it is untested.

### 21.11.2 Where the argument does *not* reach — three corrections §11 must absorb

**The escape is at the facilitator prongs, not at "marketplace".** The term is deliberately
medium-agnostic and expressly enumerates *a catalog* and *a dedicated sales software application*.
TRACT's signed catalogue feed and its buyer-side cart client are **within** the definitional term
even where no person qualifies as a facilitator. §11 may not argue "there is no marketplace"; the
available argument is only "there is no facilitator".

**Escrow is the decisive practical trigger, and in two states it is load-bearing on its own.**
Tex. Tax Code §151.0242(a)(2) catches a person who owns or operates a marketplace and "**directly or
indirectly processes sales or payments**", with no payment-processor carve-out — a gateway receiving
buyer funds and releasing them is at minimum indirectly processing. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(e)(1)(B) is
met where the person "**or contracts with a third party to collect**" the receipts, so a gateway
whose checkout routes through its own PSP is caught even though its balance sheet never holds the
money. In Washington and California payment is a qualifier rather than a standalone trigger.

**"Render-only never touches funds" is not a US answer.** It is safe in New York and Texas and
likely caught in Washington and California through the listing and order-taking prongs. A spec
resting on render-only as a non-facilitator posture is resting on two states out of fifty.

**One assertion in §11.3 is confirmed:** a self-hosted seller taking direct payment for their own
goods is never a marketplace facilitator, because every marketplace definition requires sales by
persons *other than* the owner or operator of the medium.

### 21.11.3 The adverse finding: EU VAT anticipates this design's central claim

This is the one that should change how §11 is written. The binding text is Art 5b of Council
Implementing Regulation (EU) 282/2011: an interface is **not** facilitating only if, *cumulatively*,
it (a) does not set, directly or indirectly, **any** of the terms and conditions; (b) is not,
directly or indirectly, involved in authorising the charge; and (c) is not, directly or indirectly,
involved in the ordering or delivery. The Commission's Explanatory Notes state that carrying out
**even one** of those may suffice to make an interface a facilitator.

And then, verbatim, the sentence that names TRACT's argument and rejects it:

> "The use of 'indirectly' and 'any' … is meant to prevent artificial splitting of rights and
> obligations between the electronic interface and the underlying suppliers. For example, the
> indication that the seller … is responsible for the goods sold via a marketplace/platform **or
> that the contract is concluded between the underlying supplier and the customer is not
> sufficient** to relieve the taxable person operating the electronic interface from the VAT
> obligations as a deemed supplier. The concept thus goes beyond the contractual relationship and
> looks at the **economic reality** and in particular the **influence** exercised by … electronic
> interfaces."

"The contract is between two keypairs" is precisely the assertion this text was written to defeat.
The rule tests economic reality and influence, not what the parties declare — and a protocol
asserting a contractual arrangement is, on this reading, exactly the artificial splitting the words
"indirectly" and "any" exist to catch.

The scope limit that keeps this survivable: Art 14a bites on imported consignments of intrinsic
value ≤ €150 and on supplies within the EU by non-EU-established sellers. It is not a general rule
for all EU commerce. But where it applies, no amount of protocol design argues its way out.

### 21.11.4 What §11 must now do

- **Stop arguing there is no marketplace.** There is; the argument available is that there is no
  facilitator, and only where no seller contracted with the gateway.
- **Say that escrow is the trigger**, and that in Texas and New York it is enough on its own. §9.5's
  "escrow is an operator class" understates it: escrow is also the thing most likely to make that
  operator a *tax* facilitator.
- **Stop presenting render-only as safe.** It is a two-state holding.
- **State that the EU VAT rule anticipates the design's central claim** rather than leaving a reader
  to discover it, and give the scope limit honestly rather than as reassurance.
- **Keep the four unresearched questions marked as unresearched** (§21.11), especially the GDPR
  erasure conflict, which remains the most likely hard blocker and has now survived three passes
  without an answer.

### 21.11.5 Caveats that bound all of the above

No case law anywhere. Four US states of roughly fifty, and they diverge materially. **DAC7 is
unresolved in both directions** — every DAC7 claim in this pass was voted down. The EU VAT finding
rests partly on Explanatory Notes that disclaim binding force, over an Art 5b text the CJEU has
never interpreted. Washington amended its definition in 2026; ViDA will expand EU deemed-supplier
scope; states have shown willingness to deem specific verticals in by name. **A currently-true
textual escape is not a structural guarantee**, and this section should be re-checked rather than
cited indefinitely.
