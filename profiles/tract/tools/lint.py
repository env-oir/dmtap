TRACT specification linter.

DMTAP's linter exists because four review passes over one restructure found nine internal
contradictions, and each pass found ones the previous had missed. That does not scale: the tenth
arrives with the next edit. This linter is the same idea applied from the start, so TRACT never
accumulates the debt DMTAP had to pay off retroactively.

There are fewer checks than DMTAP's, because TRACT has fewer registries so far. Each one guards an
invariant that is cheap to break and expensive to notice:

  T1  dangling section reference     a §ref pointing at a section that does not exist
  T2  document map disagrees         the §0.8 table vs the files actually on disk
  T3  normative language in a stub   a MUST inside a section still marked non-normative,
                                     which is how a draft silently starts claiming authority
  T4  unmarked stub                  a section with neither the drafting-status note nor any
                                     requirement keyword — a reader cannot tell if it is done
  T5  reference cited, not listed    an RFC cited in the body but missing from §20

Exit status is non-zero if any ERROR fires, so this belongs in CI. WARN findings are reported but
do not fail the build unless --warn-as-error is passed.

Usage:  python3 tools/lint.py [--warn-as-error] [--quiet]
