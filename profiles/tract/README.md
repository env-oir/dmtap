# TRACT

### Trade, Routing, Attestation, Custody & Trust

**An open protocol for decentralized commerce.** Goods, services, rentals and subscriptions between
self-sovereign identities — with no marketplace operator, no registrar, and no token.

*A keypair is a store. A cart is the buyer's. Delivery is computed, not brokered.*

## The one idea

A commerce platform welds together four things that need not be joined: **who you are** (an account
it issues), **what you sell** (rows in its database), **who can find you** (its ranking), and **how
you get paid** (its payment relationship). Lose the account, lose all four.

TRACT separates them:

| | Platform | TRACT |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | an account it issues | a keypair you hold |
| Catalogue | rows in its database | a signed feed you publish |
| Discovery | its ranking | a derived index anyone may rebuild |
| Settlement | its payment relationship | a seam, chosen per order by the parties |

## One shape for every trade

Every offer declares four axes. Four small closed sets, combined, express a haircut booking, a
scaffolding hire, a made-to-measure suit, a metered API, and a tin of beans — with no
category-specific code path for any of them.

| Axis | Variants |
|---|---|
| **Item** | product · variant-of-group · service · right/licence · capacity |
| **Availability** | count · time slots (RFC 5545) · capacity per interval · unlimited · made-to-order |
| **Fulfilment** | ship · collect · digital grant · perform-at-place · perform-remote · access grant · return-required |
| **Consideration** | fixed · tiered · recurring · metered · deposit+balance · quote/RFQ |

## Built on the DMTAP substrate

TRACT is not a new stack. It adopts [DMTAP](https://github.com/vul-os/dmtap)'s five substrate
capabilities — Identity, Feeds & Blobs, Sync, Infrastructure Roles, Wake — under that directory's
à-la-carte rule, and adds only the commerce spine. **No new cryptography, no new hash construction,
no new signature framing.**

## Read the evidence first

[§21 Grounding](21-grounding.md) records a July 2026 adversarially-verified literature pass,
**including the findings that contradict this specification**:

- **OpenBazaar** — the closest deployed relative of this design — shut down in 2021 having moved
  ~US$86k over 14 months, with ~80 users online at a time and one vendor faking 60% of measured
  sales value. Discovery re-centralized first; catalogues vanished when nodes went offline; opt-in
  escrow was declined by exactly the actors it existed to constrain.
- **Beckn/ONDC**, the largest live decentralized-commerce network, avoids all of that by adopting a
  central approval-gating registry with DNS/TLS identity — the opposite of this design, at the
  precise points this design is weakest.
- **There is no deployed permissionless global product identity.** The space between GS1's licensed
  monopoly namespace and a nominal merchant string is currently evidence-free.

A specification that omitted this would be easier to believe and worse to build on.

## Status

**Draft.** Every section is written; none is a placeholder.

**§16 (wire format) is normative and frozen at v0** — it defines bytes, so a change to it is a MAJOR
version change rather than a correction. That freeze is what lets conformance vectors exist at all:
a second implementation cannot prove it matches *this document* rather than matching the reference
implementation until there is something fixed to match.

Everything else carries a drafting banner and is not yet normative. A section becomes normative when
the RFC 2119 keywords appear in capitals, and `make lint` enforces that a banner-carrying section
cannot quietly acquire them — a check that has caught real drift twice.

## Implementation

[**Soko**](https://github.com/vul-os/soko) is the reference implementation — Rust, MIT, with a
crate per section of this document and tests concentrated on the failures that are silent rather
than loud: volumetric weight, currency mismatch in a route total, escrow scope intersection, place
of supply for an event held abroad, concurrent replicas not overselling.

It is **not the standard** and is not required to speak it: independent implementations must be
buildable from this specification alone, without reading any code. Where Soko and this document
disagree, **this document wins** — and if this document turns out to be unimplementable, that is a
defect here, not there.
