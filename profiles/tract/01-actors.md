## 1.1 Scope

Who the parties are, how they are identified, and how they are reached. TRACT adopts substrate
capability ① (Identity) unchanged and adds only the commerce-specific roles and disclosures.

## 1.2 What this section will specify

- The five participant roles — **seller, buyer, courier, distributor, gateway** — as roles of one
  identity type, never as separate account kinds. A single key may be all five.
- **Seller disclosure**: the fields an offer must carry to satisfy trader-traceability duties
  (legal name or trading name, contact route, establishment country, registration where held).
  This is the field set several consumer-protection regimes assume exists; §11 governs which apply.
- **Buyer disclosure tiers**: what the buyer's node attaches at browse, on grant, and at order.
- **Per-store pseudonymous subkeys**: derived so a buyer's activity is linkable *within* a seller
  (repeat-customer recognition, reviews) but not *across* sellers.
- **Reachability**: how a seller behind CGNAT is reached by key, and how an order is delivered to a
  node that is asleep or offline — the ladder, the mailbox, and wake.
- **The liveness asymmetry** (§21.5, §21.9). Durability at the edges covers *orders* and not
  *catalogues*, and this section has to make the distinction rather than let "reachable by key"
  imply both. A sleeping node still receives orders: the sender's node retains the retry queue and
  a content-free wake signal brings the recipient back. A sleeping node does **not** serve its
  catalogue, so an offline seller is not slow — they are invisible, and nobody else is obliged to
  serve their listings in their absence. The closest deployed relative of this design measured a
  ~22-day median listing lifetime and whole catalogues disappearing when a merchant node departed.
  Third-party caching or pinning of public objects therefore moves from a convenience to a
  practical requirement for any seller not always on, and unpaid replication is exactly what that
  system failed to attract. Whether pinning needs an incentive, and whether that incentive creates
  another operator, is open (§21.8).

## 1.3 Standards profiled

Ed25519 (RFC 8032), deterministic CBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2), COSE (RFC 9052), and the substrate's
`DeviceCert`, key-transparency and key-name constructions. No new key type is introduced.

## 1.4 Open

- Whether a seller's legal-disclosure block belongs in the offer, the feed head, or both.
- Subkey derivation: per-store deterministic derivation is convenient but makes the link
  recomputable by anyone who learns the root key. A stored random mapping avoids that at the cost
  of recovery complexity.
