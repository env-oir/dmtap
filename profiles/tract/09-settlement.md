## 9.1 Scope

The payment seam, rail classes, escrow, and the gateway's money role.

## 9.2 The seam names no provider

TRACT specifies where money crosses the boundary and what must be verified. It specifies no rail,
currency, token or ledger. Naming a provider in a protocol exports that provider's jurisdiction
and licensing to every implementor.

## 9.3 Rail class is part of the type

`CustodialReversible` (chargebacks exist; the card network is already the adjudicator) versus
`NonCustodialFinal` (nobody custodies, nothing reverses). An implementation must not substitute
one class for the other without an explicit party decision, because the buyer's recourse differs.

## 9.4 What this section will specify

- The payment-attestation object: payer, payee, order, amount, rail class, external settlement
  reference. **The protocol carries attestations, never funds.**
- Escrow lifecycle: fund → hold → release / refund / split, each a signed object.
- `EscrowScope`: buyer countries, seller countries, supply countries, currencies, rail classes,
  value ceiling, excluded categories, claimed authorisations.
- **Fail-closed scope intersection** at checkout, and the requirement that an empty intersection is
  disclosed rather than silently downgraded.

## 9.5 Escrow is the operator class

It requires legal standing, a payment-provider relationship, a float, and licensing — none of it
derivable from a keypair. What bounds it: permissionless entry, competition, per-order choice by
both parties, no access to identity keys, and **every ruling published as a signed object**, so an
operator that rules unfairly accumulates a permanent verifiable record.

## 9.5a The measured cost of optionality (§21.6)

§9.5 keeps escrow per-order and optional, and §9.6 gives the reason: mandatory escrow would exclude
regions no licensed operator serves. That reasoning is sound and the consequence is still real.

OpenBazaar's escrow was also opt-in, and **bad actors simply declined it** — the protection went
unused precisely where it mattered most. Both cannot be true for free, and this specification pays
on the second. What follows from that, rather than pretending it away:

- an unescrowed trade is an explicit, disclosed outcome shown to both parties before they commit,
  never a silent default;
- interfaces render the absence of escrow as a fact about the trade, not as a missing field;
- a seller declining every escrow provider a buyer trusts is itself information the buyer should be
  given, since it is the observable form of the failure above.

## 9.6 Honest limits this section must state

- Physical custody cannot be made trustless.
- Non-custodial programmatic escrow (multi-sig, hashlock+timelock) removes the custodian but
  **deadlocks on genuine disputes** — the exact case it was wanted for.
- Unescrowed trade must remain possible, or scope mismatches would exclude underserved regions.

## 9.7 Open

- Whether partial release (split rulings) needs protocol representation or is an operator concern.
