# The Coordinator Contract

**Status:** draft (the keystone new spec of the KOTVA family). Normative once ratified.

A **coordinator** is any party that provides a function the peer-to-peer substrate cannot
provide reciprocally — a global view, a scarce resource, or a legal/real-world anchor. This
document is the single contract every coordinator honors, so that "some centralization, done
safely" is a *checkable property* and not a hope. It generalizes DMTAP's legacy-mail gateway
(§7) and legacy adapters (§26) into one reusable shape; both are instances of it.

The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY are BCP 14.

## 1. Why coordinators exist (and why they are fenced)

The peer substrate handles custody, transport, and single-writer-per-resource state without a
coordinator. Four jobs it cannot do reciprocally:

- **Global-view optimization** — matching, ranking, search.
- **Scarce-resource egress** — a reputable IP + unblocked port 25 (mail), a public address.
- **Real-world / legal anchoring** — licensing, liability, physical-event attestation.
- **Cross-party judgement** — moderation labels, dispute arbitration.

Each is a place centralization can regrow. The contract confines the damage: a coordinator is
**hired, not depended-on**. No coordinator is load-bearing, so none can become a gatekeeper.
The sole exception is the **custodial escrow operator**, which holds the float for a trade
window and is therefore structurally load-bearing and does not fade — disclosed here rather
than hidden (see primitives/ESCROW.md).

---

## 2. The four conformance clauses (normative)

Every coordinator MUST satisfy all four.

### 2.1 Accountable
A coordinator MUST have an **attested identity** (a substrate keypair, §Identity) and MUST
publish a **signed descriptor** carrying its kind, its policy, and — where it charges — a
signed tariff. The descriptor is **discovery-only and self-asserted**: it carries no global
reputation score, no price ranking, and no stake field. Reputation is **locally measured** by
each client from its own results, never a globally published number (DMTAP §7.5, generalized).
Stake is kept out of the descriptor for the same reason price-ranking is — see §6 for where and
how a relying party verifies it instead.

### 2.2 Swappable
Leaving a coordinator MUST be a **configuration change with zero data migration and zero
identity change**. A user's keys, mailbox, listings, and history live at the edge; a
coordinator holds only rebuildable operational state. Switching or dropping one MUST NOT
require re-telling correspondents or re-establishing identity. Lock-in is a conformance
violation, not a business model.

### 2.3 Self-hostable
For every coordinator kind there MUST exist a **self-host backstop**: a user who can meet the
kind's requirement can always run it for themselves and depend on no third party. Exactly one
honest exception **class** is disclosed rather than papered over — a **scarce network-
reachability class**, with two members: a reputable IP + unblocked port 25 for legacy SMTP
egress (the `gateway`), and a public reachable ingress for the `reachability-adapter`. Both
members are a network resource a third party (ISP/host) allocates, not something a user can
always self-provision. The contract confines the scarcity to this one reachability class instead
of letting it spread to custody, naming, or moderation. (THREAT-MODEL.md R-6 names this same
class and its residual; its text is a member short and should be updated to name both members
consistently with this section.)

### 2.4 Content-visibility declared
Every coordinator MUST declare, in its descriptor, exactly one **visibility class** at one
**assurance level** (§3), and MUST surface it to users. Advertising one class while operating
another is non-conformant misrepresentation, not policy.

---

## 3. The content-visibility property (normative)

This formalizes what §4/§7/§26 already gesture at, into a first-class, declared, checkable
property of every intermediary.

### 3.1 Visibility class — declare exactly one

| Class | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **`blind`** | Forwards/holds ciphertext, holds no key that decrypts the payload, reads neither content nor routing beyond what the wire exposes. | mesh relay (Circuit Relay v2), mix, TURN-over-SFrame |
| **`blind-routing`** | Cannot read the payload; sees routing metadata (envelope, SNI, addresses, size, timing). | SNI-passthrough ingress, buffer/mailbox, SFU media-relay (RFC 9605 — reads per-frame metadata, RTP routing, stream sizes, speaker timing, and participant graph to make forwarding decisions; media payload stays sealed by SFrame) |
| **`terminating`** | Terminates encryption and sees plaintext — a deliberate, disclosed trust boundary. | legacy mail gateway, TLS-terminating ingress |

### 3.2 The four rules
- **MUST declare** its class (no silent default).
- **No silent downgrade** — a coordinator that *can* run `blind`/`blind-routing` MUST NOT run
  `terminating` without explicit disclosure (cf. the TLS no-downgrade rule, DMTAP §7.2).
- **Client MUST surface** the class — the user sees which trust boundary a path crosses.
- **Prefer-blind default** — where a function can be served blind (SNI-passthrough vs.
  TLS-terminating), `blind` is RECOMMENDED and `terminating` requires opt-in + disclosure.

### 3.3 Assurance level — how blindness is guaranteed
"Blind" is not one strength. A coordinator SHOULD state which level it offers:

| Level | Guarantee | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| **`structural`** | The role *has no key* — E2E encryption makes reading impossible. | strongest; provable |
| **`attested`** | The role runs in a **TEE** that proves the code only forwards and holds no key. | hardware-trust |
| **`declared`** | The operator *promises* it is blind; nothing structurally prevents cheating. | honest-trust |

### 3.4 Honest residual (normative disclosure)
The contract can mandate the *architecture* that makes blindness possible (E2E encryption so
the coordinator **cannot** read) and the *declaration* rules above. It **cannot**
cryptographically prove a `declared`-level operator is not secretly logging — only
`structural` and `attested` are verifiable. A visibility declaration proves a coordinator's
architecture and intent, **never** that a `declared`-level operator is honest (DMTAP §7.10.4,
generalized). Clients MUST NOT present a `declared`-level `blind` claim as if it were verified.

---

## 4. Authorize, never classify (normative)

Every gate a coordinator applies **on a delivery path or a canonical/authoritative path** MUST
be an **authorization** question answered from **sender identity and rate** — *is this party who
they claim, and within their limits?* On that path, a coordinator MUST NOT run content
classification (spam scoring, ML filters, keyword/URL reputation) and MUST NOT drop, quarantine,
re-rank, or annotate on a content basis. "Wanted" is a property of a relationship, judged by the
recipient, on the recipient's device, against the recipient's own corpus.

This is structural, not a preference: a coordinator that classifies content on a delivery or
authoritative path becomes permanent by construction (classification improves with corpus size,
so it centralizes, and it never "finishes"). The rule is what stops anti-abuse from forming a
second centralized tier (DMTAP §7.11.4, generalized to every coordinator).

**Anti-abuse that _is_ allowed:** authenticated-by-default identity, anonymous-but-accountable
rate-limit tokens, optional postage/proof-of-work for cold contact, and — for moderation — a
**market of opt-in labelers** each of which is itself a coordinator under this contract (it
labels; you subscribe to the ones you trust; you can leave).

**Derived-view carve-out (labelers, indexers, matchers):** a coordinator MAY classify, annotate,
rank, or re-rank content within its **own derived, non-authoritative, opt-in, subscribable
view** — this is exactly what the `labeler` kind does (it classifies content into labels; you
subscribe to the ones you trust) and what `indexer`/`matcher` do (they rank their own corpus or
match set). The §4 prohibition is scoped to a **delivery path** or a **canonical/authoritative
path**: a coordinator MUST NOT classify, annotate, drop, gate, quarantine, or re-rank content
that reaches — or is withheld from — a recipient by default. "Classify/rank my own opt-in view"
is permitted; "gate what reaches you" is not.

## 5. Coordinator kinds (all instances of the contract)

| Kind | Provides | Typical visibility |
|---|---|---|
| **gateway** | Legacy-mail bridge (MX, DKIM egress, legacy client surfaces) | `terminating` (legacy leg is plaintext) |
| **relay** | Mesh reachability for NAT'd peers | `blind` / structural |
| **media-relay** | Forwards SFrame-encrypted call/stream media (scales calls) | `blind-routing` / structural — media payload sealed by SFrame; per-frame metadata, RTP routing, size, timing, participant graph are visible to the SFU (RFC 9605) |
| **reachability-adapter** | ngrok-style public subdomains for arbitrary box services | `blind-routing` (SNI-passthrough) preferred |
| **indexer** | Search / discovery / global product-and-price view | corpus is public plaintext (nothing to be blind about); query-channel `terminating` unless `attested` |
| **labeler** | Moderation labels, opt-in, subscribable | n/a (labels public objects) |
| **matcher** | Real-time supply↔demand matching (rides, delivery) | **terminating** (default) / **attested** (TEE) |
| **compute** *(provisional)* | Hosted/outsourced computation (e.g. private-AI inference on rented GPU) | `terminating` (default) / `attested` (TEE, for blind compute) |
| **arbiter** | Dispute resolution (staked jury) | `terminating` for evidence, disclosed |
| **oracle** | Physical-world / real-fact attestation (delivered? ride done?) | `terminating`, disclosed |
| **custodial-escrow** | Holds the trade float for a trade window ([primitives/ESCROW.md](primitives/ESCROW.md) SEC-6a) | `terminating` for evidence, disclosed — the family's **one load-bearing exception** (§1) |

`gateway` (DMTAP §7) and the legacy `adapter`s (§26) are the first, fully-worked instances;
every kind above inherits the four clauses and the visibility property unchanged. `custodial-escrow`
satisfies all four clauses like every other kind but, uniquely, does not fade once hired — see §1
and [primitives/ESCROW.md](primitives/ESCROW.md) §9–§10 (SEC-6a, "the one honest load-bearing
exception").

## 6. Economics (normative boundary)

- **In scope:** the authorization *mechanism*, the visibility declaration, the descriptor and
  signed tariff, and — where a coordinator meters — **signed usage receipts** delivered
  directly to the paying party (auditable, never merely asserted).
- **Out of scope (operator policy):** the *numbers* — quotas, rate limits, prices — and the
  settlement rail (an existing stablecoin or fiat; KOTVA brokers none and takes no cut).
- **Stake verification (where a kind requires stake).** §2.1 excludes a stake field from the
  descriptor so stake cannot become a ranking signal. Where a kind carries skin-in-the-game
  (`arbiter`, `oracle` — DIRECTION §5, "sized to the value at risk"), the stake MUST instead be
  verifiable **on the settlement/staking rail itself** — e.g. an on-chain stake balance or lock a
  client can query directly (Kleros-class staked arbitration, OpenRank-class staked attestation,
  DIRECTION §3) — never merely asserted in the descriptor or taken on faith. A client relying on a
  staked coordinator MUST verify the on-rail stake meets the value at risk before relying on it;
  an unverifiable stake claim MUST be treated as no stake (SEC-1, fail closed).
- **Never:** a protocol token, an advertising mechanism, or a payout-fairness scheme. Absent
  by decision.

A user's audit is **one-directional** (DMTAP §7.9, generalized): a signed receipt lets a user
confirm a claimed operation was real; it cannot disconfirm an operation the coordinator
fabricated. Disclosed, not hidden.

| COORD-7 | if metered, issues signed usage receipts directly to the payer | §6 |
| COORD-8 | mints no token; stakes/settles only in existing assets | §6, DIRECTION §5 |
