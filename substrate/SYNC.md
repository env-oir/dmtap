# Substrate Capability ③ — Sync

> **Status:** this is the **one genuinely new normative specification** in the substrate. Unlike
> [`IDENTITY.md`](IDENTITY.md) and [`FEEDS.md`](FEEDS.md), which *profile* existing sections, this
> document specifies machinery that no single numbered section fully covers: a **signed, deterministic,
> multi-author CRDT operation algebra with range-Merkle reconciliation, first-class signed snapshots,
> and sparse namespace sync.** Its **semantics are grounded in** the existing §5.6 device-cluster CRDTs
> (the `dmtap-clustersync` reference), and its **wire shape is grounded in** the flowstock stateless
> sync protocol (`GET /sync/vector` · `POST /sync/pull` · `POST /sync/ops`). Where this document and
> §5.6 agree, §5.6 remains the normative home of the *single-owner device-cluster* profile and governs
> it; this document is the normative home of the **multi-author generalization** and everything below
> that §5.6 does not specify.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**,
**RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119 / RFC 8174.

**Proposed registries.** This document proposes a new error-subsystem byte **`0x0A`** (`0x0A00`–`0x0AFF`,
"SYNC substrate") and a capability token `sync-1`, registered additively under the §21.14
new-subsystem-byte policy and §10.2 — exactly as §22 (DMTAP-PUB) registered subsystem `0x09` and `pub-1`.
No existing code, token, or top-level version is changed; a node that does not advertise `sync-1` is
never expected to speak it.

## 1. The one idea, and the flowstock test

A product that keeps structured state — inventory, a document, a settings tree, a task board — on more
than one replica needs those replicas to **converge without a coordinator**, tolerate offline edits, and
**merge deterministically** so that every replica that has seen the same operations computes byte-identical
state. That is a CRDT. DMTAP already has one (§5.6), but §5.6 is scoped to **a single owner's device
cluster**, where all writers are devices of one identity and authenticity is supplied by an ambient MLS
group (ops ride *unsigned* inside an encrypted, membership-authenticated group).

The substrate generalizes this to **multi-author** sync — any set of independent identities converging on
shared state — by making the **operation itself the unit of authenticity**: each op is **COSE-signed**
(RFC 9052) by an author key that chains, via a `DeviceCert`, to an `IK` ([`IDENTITY.md`](IDENTITY.md)).
No shared secret group is required, so two products built by different parties can converge on any
namespace they both subscribe to.

This document **MUST pass the flowstock test** ([`README.md § 4.1`](README.md#41-the-flowstock-test--can-a-product-sync-without-reading-mail)):
a product that syncs structured state **MUST be able to implement it from this document plus
[`IDENTITY.md`](IDENTITY.md) alone** — the op algebra, the signing rule, the reconciliation wire
protocol, snapshots, and sparse sync are all specified here, with no forward reference into §2/§5/§7/§8
that a reader must chase to get the bytes right. References into §5.6 for *grounding* are informative.

---

## 2. Model

### 2.1 Replicas, authors, objects, namespaces

- A **replica** is a store that holds sync state and exchanges ops with peer replicas. Any node may be a
  replica; there is **no primary and no coordinator** (leaderless).
- An **author** is an identity (an `IK`, §1.2) that produces ops. Each op is signed by an operational
  **author key** certified to that `IK` by a `DeviceCert` (§1.2). *Multi-device of one owner* is the
  special case where every author key chains to the *same* `IK` — that is the §5.6 device cluster.
  *Multi-owner* is the general case where author keys chain to *different* `IK`s admitted by policy (§9).
- An **object** is a keyed piece of state (`target`, a string id) whose value is governed by exactly one
  **CRDT type** (§4). A **field** further keys a register or counter within an object.
- A **namespace** (`ns`, a short string) partitions objects into independently-syncable collections. A
  replica **subscribes** to a set of namespaces and exchanges ops only within them (§7, sparse sync). The
  empty namespace `""` is the default single-collection case.

### 2.2 Determinism is the contract

Every merge in this document is a **join** — commutative, associative, and idempotent — over
deterministically-encoded state, so **any two replicas that have applied the same set of ops compute the
same bytes.** Two rules make this hold across independent implementations:

1. **Deterministic CBOR everywhere.** Every op, snapshot, and reconciliation message is encoded as
   deterministic CBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2, §18.1.1): shortest-form integers, integer-keyed maps sorted by
   encoded key, no floats/tags/indefinite lengths, `null` rejected on the wire, unknown keys rejected in
   signed objects (§18.1.2). JSON appears **only** at a client edge (as JMAP does for mail, §8), never on
   the sync wire.
2. **Total order on every tie.** The tiebreak for any "latest wins" decision is the **Hybrid Logical
   Clock** total order (§3), and where two ops carry the *identical* HLC the tiebreak descends to the
   **encoded-CBOR value bytes** (larger byte string wins) — so even "same HLC, different value" converges
   byte-identically. No merge ever depends on wall-clock accuracy or on arrival order.

---

## 3. Time: Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)

Causality and ordering use an HLC, grounded in the §5.6 cluster HLC and the flowstock HLC.

```cddl
Hlc = {
  1 => u64,      ; wall     unix milliseconds (ordering hint + skew bound, NOT relied on for correctness)
  2 => u32,      ; counter  logical tick within a wall-ms
  3 => ik-pub,   ; author   the author key producing this timestamp (globally unique tiebreak)
}
```

- **Total order (normative).** HLCs compare **lexicographically by `(wall, counter, author)`**. Because
  `author` is a public key, no two distinct authors ever tie, so the order is total across all replicas.
- **Tick (local mint).** On producing an op: `now = wall_clock_ms()`; if `now > wall` then
  `wall = now, counter = 0`; else `counter += 1`. Strictly monotonic per author.
- **Observe (on receiving a remote op).** Fold the remote HLC forward: if `remote.wall > wall`, or
  (`remote.wall == wall` and `remote.counter >= counter`), advance `wall`/`counter` past it, so a future
  local tick always sorts after every op already seen. This makes a backwards or fast wall clock unable
  to mint a stale-ordering timestamp.
- **Skew bound (fail-closed).** An op whose `wall` is more than the profile skew window (§16-class value,
  default **±120 s**, from §5.6 `HLC_SKEW_MS`) from the receiver's clock is rejected
  (`ERR_SYNC_HLC_SKEW`, `0x0A05`). This bounds how far a malicious author can push ordering into the
  future or past.

> **Grounding.** The flowstock reference encodes the HLC as a lexically-sortable string
> `"{ms:013d}-{counter:04x}-{author}"`; the §5.6 reference encodes it as an integer-keyed CBOR map.
> The substrate normative encoding is the CBOR map above (deterministic CBOR is the substrate primitive,
> §2.2); a string form is an equivalent client-edge convenience and MUST canonicalize to the same order.

---

## 4. The CRDT operation algebra

An operation is the atomic, signed mutation. All six CRDT types share one op envelope; `kind` selects the
type and dictates which fields are meaningful.

### 4.1 The `SyncOp` envelope

```cddl
SyncOp = {
  1  => u8,          ; kind    CRDT/op discriminator (§4.2–§4.7 table below)
  2  => tstr,        ; ns      namespace (§7); "" = default
  3  => tstr,        ; target  object id
  ? 4 => tstr,       ; field   register/counter field, RGA/tree edge selector — per-kind
  ? 5 => cv,         ; value   ext-value payload (LWW value, counter delta, RGA atom) — per-kind
  6  => Hlc,         ; hlc     the op's HLC (§3); its `author` is the producing key
  ? 7 => [+ AddTag], ; observed OR-Set: the specific add-tags a remove cancels — per-kind
  ? 8 => OpRef,      ; ref     RGA left-origin / tree parent / prev-chain reference — per-kind
}
AddTag = { 1 => ik-pub, 2 => Hlc }   ; a globally-unique add identity: (author, hlc)
OpRef  = { 1 => tstr, ? 2 => Hlc }   ; a reference to another element by (target[, hlc])
cv     = ext-value                    ; the deterministic-safe value subset of §18.3.6
```

- `value` is restricted to the **`ext-value` subset** (§18.3.6): text, byte strings, unsigned/negative
  integers, booleans, and homogeneous arrays thereof — **no** integer-keyed maps, floats, tags, or
  `null`, so a value can never smuggle an un-canonicalizable or ambiguous encoding (the §5.6
  `is_ext_value` rule). A violating op is rejected (`ERR_SYNC_OP_INVALID`, `0x0A03`).
- **Authenticity: each `SyncOp` is COSE-signed.** The wire object is a **`COSE_Sign1`** (RFC 9052) whose
  payload is `det_cbor(SyncOp)` and whose protected header binds the signer's author key; the DS-tag
  `DMTAP-SYNC-v0/op ‖ 0x00` domain-separates the signing preimage (§18.1.6). The signature MUST verify
  under the `hlc.author` key, and that key MUST chain to an admitted `IK` via a non-revoked `DeviceCert`
  (§9). A failure is `ERR_SYNC_OP_SIG_INVALID` (`0x0A02`, FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK); an unauthorized author is
  `ERR_SYNC_AUTHOR_UNAUTHORIZED` (`0x0A01`).
  - **Batching (OPTIONAL, amortized signatures).** A producer MAY emit a **`SyncFrame`** — a hash-chained
    run of that author's ops with a single `COSE_Sign1` over the frame head — so the signature amortizes
    over many ops, exactly as a signed `FeedHead` transitively commits a chain of unsigned `FeedEntry`s
    ([`FEEDS.md § 4.1`](FEEDS.md), §22.4.1) and a signed cluster-journal segment commits its ops
    (§5.6.3(b)). Within a frame, each op carries `ref` = the content hash of the prior op, genesis
    excepted; a broken back-link is `ERR_SYNC_FRAME_CHAIN_BROKEN` (`0x0A08`, HALT_ALERT). Per-op signing
    (baseline) and frame signing (amortized) are interchangeable on the wire and negotiated by `sync-1`
    sub-tokens.

### 4.2 Op kinds

| `kind` | Name | CRDT type | Uses fields |
|:------:|------|-----------|-------------|
| `1` | `set-add` | OR-Set (add-wins) | `target`, `value`=element, `hlc` (the add-tag) |
| `2` | `set-remove` | OR-Set | `target`, `value`=element, `observed`=cancelled add-tags |
| `3` | `lww-set` | LWW register | `target`, `field`, `value`, `hlc` |
| `4` | `death` | remove-wins death-certificate | `target`, `field`=death class or `"live"`, `hlc` |
| `5` | `counter` | PN-counter | `target`, `field`, `value`=signed delta, `hlc` |
| `6` | `seq-insert` | RGA sequence | `target`, `value`=atom, `ref`=left origin, `hlc`=element id |
| `7` | `seq-remove` | RGA sequence | `target`, `ref`=element to tombstone |
| `8` | `tree-move` | movable tree | `target`=node, `ref`=new parent, `field`=ordering key, `hlc` |

### 4.3 OR-Set — add-wins observed-remove (grounded in §5.6)

- **State.** Per element: a set of **add-tags** `{author, hlc}` and a set of tombstoned add-tags.
- **`set-add`** inserts a fresh, globally-unique add-tag (its own `hlc`). **`set-remove`** tombstones the
  **specific** add-tags listed in `observed` — it cancels only adds the remover had seen, so a concurrent
  unseen add survives (**add-wins**). A remove may legitimately arrive before its add and still converge.
- **Presence.** An element is present iff it has **at least one add-tag not covered by a tombstone**.
- **Merge** is per-element set union of adds and of tombstones (a join).
- **Causal integrity (fail-closed).** A `set-remove` MUST cite ≥1 add-tag, and **no cited add-tag may
  post-date the remove's own HLC** ("you cannot have observed an add from the future") — a violation is
  `ERR_SYNC_OP_INVALID` (`0x0A03`). This validity is state-free, so it never depends on local order.

### 4.4 LWW register — last-writer-wins by HLC (grounded in §5.6)

- **State.** Per `(target, field)`: a single `(hlc, value)` cell.
- **`lww-set`** writes `(hlc, value)`. **Winner = greater HLC.** At an **exact HLC tie** (only possible
  same-author same-tick, or a forged duplicate), the winner is the one whose **`det_cbor(value)` byte
  string is larger** — so convergence is byte-identical even under a tie.
- **Merge** keeps the winning cell (a join).

### 4.5 Death-certificate — remove-wins durable delete (grounded in §5.6)

For deletions that must **not** be silently resurrected by a concurrent benign edit (privacy redactions,
expiries, policy removals), the death dimension **dominates** the OR-Set.

- **State.** Per object: an LWW register over `DeathState ∈ {Live, Deleted(class)}`, where
  `Deleted > Live` in the state order and `class ∈ {redact, expires, sensitive}` (an ordered enum).
- **`death` (kind 4)** writes `Deleted(class)` (field = the class token) or `Live` (field = `"live"`).
  **Winner = greater HLC; at an exact HLC tie, greater `DeathState` wins ⇒ `Deleted` beats `Live`
  (remove-wins, fail-safe toward deletion).**
- **Domination (the D3 invariant).** An object is observably present iff **`!deaths.is_deleted(target)`
  AND the OR-Set says present.** A bare `set-add` never writes the death dimension, so it can **never**
  outrank a death certificate — even with a numerically greater wall clock. Only an explicit `Live`
  write with a **strictly greater** HLC than the certificate revives an object. This closes the
  resurrection hole where a concurrent re-label would revive redacted content.

### 4.6 PN-counter — increment/decrement (NEW; standard positive-negative counter)

No §5.6 analogue exists; specified here for products that count (inventory on-hand, votes, quotas).

- **State.** Two per-author maps `P` (increments) and `N` (decrements): `P[a], N[a] ∈ u64`.
- **`counter` (kind 5)** carries a **signed delta** in `value` and applies to the **author's own**
  entry: a positive delta `d` sets `P[author] += d`; a negative delta `−d` sets `N[author] += d`. An
  author may only advance its **own** `P[author]`/`N[author]` (a signed op from author `a` MUST NOT
  mutate `P[b]`), enforced by the op signature — `ERR_SYNC_COUNTER_FOREIGN` (`0x0A06`) otherwise.
- **Value.** `Σ_a P[a] − Σ_a N[a]`.
- **Merge** is per-author **max** of `P` and of `N` (a join) — idempotent and order-independent, so
  redelivered deltas never double-count. The `hlc` orders an author's own successive deltas; because the
  merge is max-per-author, replay is a no-op.

> **Alternative for immutable ledgers.** A product whose counter is a sum of immutable facts (flowstock's
> `stock_movements`, summed at read time) MAY instead model each movement as a `set-add` of an immutable
> record and derive the total by a read-side `SUM` — a set-union CRDT with no counter state at all. This
> is the flowstock choice and is often simpler than a PN-counter where every increment is an auditable
> event. The PN-counter is for a *scalar* whose history need not be retained.

### 4.7 RGA sequence — ordered list (NEW; Replicated Growable Array)

For ordered text or lists that multiple authors edit concurrently (a shared document line, an ordered
checklist). No §5.6 analogue; specified here.

- **State.** A set of **atoms**, each with a unique **element id** = its insertion `hlc` (`{author,…}`
  globally unique), a **left-origin** reference (`ref`, the element id it was inserted immediately after;
  the sentinel `⊥` = list head), an `ext-value` payload, and a tombstone flag.
- **`seq-insert` (kind 6)** creates an atom whose id is its `hlc`, inserted after `ref`. **`seq-remove`
  (kind 7)** tombstones the atom named by `ref` (tombstones are retained until GC, §6, so a concurrent
  insert whose origin is a removed atom still resolves).
- **Order (normative RGA rule).** Atoms sharing a left-origin are ordered by **descending element-id HLC**
  (later insertions sort *earlier* among same-origin siblings — the standard RGA "insert-after with
  newer-first" rule), recursively; the sequence is the pre-order walk of this tree skipping tombstoned
  atoms. Because element ids are HLC-total-ordered, the resulting sequence is identical on every replica
  that has applied the same op set. An insert referencing an unknown origin is **buffered** until the
  origin arrives (causal readiness), not rejected — `ERR_SYNC_SEQ_ORIGIN_MISSING` (`0x0A07`) is raised
  only if the buffer is bounded and overflows, never as a convergence fault.
- **Merge** is set union of atoms + union of tombstones (a join); the order is recomputed by the rule
  above, so merge is order-independent.

### 4.8 Movable tree — hierarchy with safe moves (NEW; cycle-safe replicated tree)

For a tree that multiple authors reparent concurrently (a folder/outline/scene graph). No §5.6 analogue.

- **State.** Each node holds an LWW register over `(parent, ordering_key)` — its edge to its parent.
- **`tree-move` (kind 8)** LWW-writes `(ref=new_parent, field=ordering_key)` on `target`; latest HLC
  wins per node (as §4.4), exact-tie by encoded value.
- **The one hard problem — cycles.** Concurrent moves can form a cycle (A→under→B while B→under→A). The
  substrate adopts the **deterministic cycle-resolution rule** (Kleppmann's highly-available replicated
  tree): after applying moves in **HLC order**, any move that *would* create a cycle is **skipped** (its
  effect discarded) deterministically on every replica, because every replica applies the same ops in the
  same total order. Skipped moves are recorded as no-ops, never errors; the tree is always acyclic. A
  replica that receives an out-of-order move **re-evaluates** from the affected subtree in HLC order (the
  standard "undo-move / redo in order" procedure). This is the only kind whose apply is **not** a pure
  per-op join — it is a deterministic *replay in HLC order* — and a conformant implementation MUST
  produce the acyclic result the ordered replay defines.

### 4.9 Immutable content needs no CRDT

Content-addressed blobs (chunks, `PubManifest`s, MOTEs) are immutable and **need no merge** — they are
referenced *from* CRDT state (an LWW value or an RGA atom MAY carry a content hash), and the bytes are
fetched and self-verified by the Feeds/blob path ([`FEEDS.md`](FEEDS.md), §5.5). Sync moves the *pointers*
deterministically; the content layer moves the *bytes* by content address.

---

## 5. Reconciliation wire protocol

Two replicas reconcile by exchanging ops each lacks. The baseline is the flowstock stateless
version-vector protocol; a **range-based Merkle** mode (grounded in the §5.6 `recon` reference) scales it
to large states. Bodies are deterministic CBOR (§2.2); a JSON edge is permitted only for a
non-interoperating local client. Endpoints are shown as HTTP (the HTTP test,
[`README.md § 4.2`](README.md#42-the-http-test--are-transports-pluggable-with-https-first-class)); the
same three-or-four operations bind equally to a mesh stream (§4.5).

### 5.1 The version vector

A **version vector** is a per-author high-water-mark of applied HLCs, over the subscribed namespaces:

```cddl
VersionVector = { * ik-pub => Hlc }   ; author => the max HLC applied from that author
```

Grounded in flowstock's `SELECT author, MAX(hlc) GROUP BY author`. A vector is not causal-delivery state;
it is a compact summary of "what I already have," used to compute the difference to ship.

### 5.2 Endpoints (baseline, grounded in flowstock)

```
GET  /sync/vector                → { node: ik-pub, ns: [tstr], vector: VersionVector }
POST /sync/pull   { vector, ns } → { ops: [ COSE_Sign1(SyncOp) | SyncFrame ] }   ; ops the caller lacks
POST /sync/ops    { ops }        → { applied: u32 }                              ; push ops to the peer
```

- **`GET /sync/vector`** returns the responder's node key, the namespaces it subscribes to, and its
  current `VersionVector`. (flowstock: `{node_id, vector}`.)
- **`POST /sync/pull`** sends the caller's vector (+ requested namespaces); the responder returns, oldest
  HLC first, up to a batch limit, every op it holds whose `hlc` exceeds the caller's vector entry for that
  op's author (or whose author is absent from the vector). (flowstock: `OpsAfter(vector, batch)`.)
- **`POST /sync/ops`** pushes a batch; the responder applies each op that is new (dedup by op content
  hash / `hlc`), verifying signature (§4.1) and CRDT validity (§4) before apply, and returns the count of
  **newly** applied ops. Apply is idempotent: a re-pushed op is a no-op (matching flowstock's
  `INSERT OR IGNORE` oplog-dedup).
- **A round is symmetric** (push-then-pull), so only one side of a pair need be reachable and ops relay
  transitively through any topology (hub-and-spoke, mesh, chain) — the flowstock property. Fetching is
  **read-only and content-addressable at the op level**, so responses are cacheable and a lying responder
  can withhold or stall (detectable as a vector that never advances) but **cannot forge** an op (that
  needs an author key) — the same trustless posture as [`FEEDS.md § 5.1`](FEEDS.md).

### 5.3 Range-based Merkle reconciliation (scalable mode, grounded in §5.6 `recon`)

The baseline `pull` scans all ops after a vector — fine for small states, but O(history) to *find* the
difference when two large replicas differ in only a few ops. The **range-Merkle** mode finds the
difference in O(log n · divergence) by recursively fingerprinting HLC-ordered ranges:

```
POST /sync/fingerprint { ns, ranges: [ { lo: Hlc, hi: Hlc, fp: hash, count: u64 } ] }
   → { mismatched: [ { lo, hi, split: [subrange fingerprints] | ops: [...] } ] }
```

- Each side computes, over the HLC-sorted op ids in a range `[lo, hi)`, a **fingerprint** `fp` = a folded
  BLAKE3 hash of the ordered op content-addresses, plus a `count`. Equal `(fp, count)` ⇒ the ranges are
  identical, **no data exchanged**. On mismatch, the range is **split** (by op count, into a small fixed
  fan-out) and the sub-range fingerprints are exchanged recursively; a range that shrinks below a
  threshold ships its ops directly. This is the standard range-based set-reconciliation algorithm
  (Meyer/`recon`), operating over the HLC total order so ranges are canonical on both sides.
- Range-Merkle is a **discovery optimization only** — every op it surfaces is applied through the same
  §4 verify+merge path; it changes *how the difference is found*, never *what converges*. A node
  advertises it as a `sync-1` sub-token; a peer that lacks it falls back to §5.2 baseline `pull`.

### 5.4 Auth on the wire

The reconciliation transport itself is authenticated per the deployment (§9): a single-owner cluster
gates peers by MLS group membership or a shared bearer secret over a trusted network (the flowstock model:
constant-time bearer compare, fail-closed on an empty secret); a multi-owner deployment gates by an
Identity-authenticated session ([`ROLES.md`](ROLES.md) announce/resolve + a DPoP/WebAuthn-class bound
token, §13). **Transport auth is orthogonal to op auth:** even over a fully trusted transport, every op
MUST carry its own valid COSE signature (§4.1) — the transport gate controls *who may sync*, the op
signature controls *who authored each change*.

---

## 6. Snapshots & compaction (first-class)

A new replica must not have to replay all history, and an old replica must not grow unbounded. Both are
**first-class** here (the §5.6 reference GCs but does not ship signed portable checkpoints; flowstock does
neither and grows unbounded — this section is the substrate's genuinely new contribution on top of both).

### 6.1 Signed snapshots

```cddl
Snapshot = {
  1 => u8,               ; v = 0
  2 => suite,
  3 => tstr,             ; ns          the namespace this snapshot covers
  4 => VersionVector,    ; covers      the exact set of ops folded into `root` (per-author max HLC)
  5 => hash,             ; root        DS-tagged hash of the canonical observable state (§6.2)
  6 => ts,
  7 => ik-pub,           ; signer      author key; DeviceCert chains to an admitted IK (§9)
  8 => sig-val,          ; signer over det_cbor(Snapshot ∖ {8}), DS-tag DMTAP-SYNC-v0/snapshot
}
```

- **`root` is a deterministic function of observable state.** The producer serializes the *observable*
  state of the namespace — present OR-Set members, sorted LWW cells, PN-counter totals per object,
  live RGA sequences, the acyclic tree — as canonical deterministic CBOR and hashes it with the DS-tag
  `DMTAP-SYNC-v0/snapshot ‖ 0x00`. This is exactly the §5.6 `ClusterState::snapshot()` canonical form,
  generalized across all six CRDT types. Two replicas at the same `covers` vector **MUST** compute the
  same `root`; a mismatch is `ERR_SYNC_SNAPSHOT_ROOT_MISMATCH` (`0x0A09`) and is evidence of divergence
  (HALT_ALERT).
- **Fast join (the point).** A joining replica fetches a `Snapshot`, adopts its observable state, sets its
  local vector to `covers`, and then pulls **only the ops after `covers`** (§5.2) — it never replays the
  pre-snapshot history. Because `root` is recomputable, a replica that later backfills the pre-snapshot
  ops **MUST** recompute `root` and confirm it matches — a snapshot is **verifiable, not merely trusted**.
- **Trust posture (honest).** A replica that adopts a snapshot *without* backfilling trusts the `signer`
  for the pre-`covers` history until it verifies. A deployment therefore fixes a **snapshot trust
  policy**: (a) *verify-required* — accept a snapshot only from a signer whose `root` the replica can
  recompute from ops it will fetch (self-hosting, high-assurance); or (b) *trusted-checkpoint* — accept a
  snapshot on the signer's authority for bootstrap speed, with the disclosed residual that a malicious
  signer could present a false starting state (bounded, because every op *after* `covers` is still
  independently signed and verified, so divergence surfaces at the next snapshot boundary). The policy
  MUST be explicit; silently trusting an unverifiable snapshot is prohibited (fail-closed governance,
  §10.7).

### 6.2 Compaction via stability cut (grounded in §5.6)

Tombstones (OR-Set, RGA) and superseded LWW/death cells can be dropped once **every live replica has
advanced past them**, so no future op can depend on them:

- The **stability cut** is the **minimum, across every live subscribed replica, of that replica's
  max-applied HLC** (folding in the local max). A replica publishes its watermark as a signed
  `StabilityMark { author, hlc }` (§5.6). A **stale** replica — not seen within the liveness window
  (§16-class) — is **excluded** from the min, so a dead-but-unrevoked replica cannot stall compaction; a
  live replica with *no known* watermark yields **no cut** (fail-closed: never GC on incomplete
  knowledge).
- Below the cut: an OR-Set add-tag present in **both** adds and tombstones is dropped (it can never again
  affect presence, since its `{author, hlc}` is globally unique); an RGA atom that is tombstoned and below
  the cut is dropped; a superseded LWW/death cell below the cut needs no history. Compaction **never
  changes observable state** — it only discards proof-obligations no live replica can still raise.
- **Op-log truncation.** Once a snapshot at vector `V` exists and every live replica has advanced past
  `V`, the op-log prefix below `V` MAY be truncated; the retained suffix plus the snapshot reconstruct the
  state. (The §5.6 journal `truncate_before` with the same "every member replayed past it" obligation.)

## 7. Sparse / partial sync (namespaces)

A replica need not hold everything. **Sparse sync** lets a replica subscribe to a subset of namespaces —
a phone that syncs only "recent" while the home box holds "all," or a shop terminal that syncs only its
own branch.

- Every op carries `ns` (§4.1). A replica **subscribes** to a set of namespaces and advertises it in
  `GET /sync/vector` (`ns: [tstr]`). `pull`/`fingerprint`/`ops` are **scoped to the intersection** of the
  two peers' subscriptions; a namespace the caller did not subscribe to is never shipped to it.
- The `VersionVector`, snapshots, and stability cut are all **per-namespace**: convergence, anti-rollback,
  and compaction are sound *within* each namespace independently. A replica that later widens its
  subscription bootstraps the new namespace via its snapshot + post-snapshot ops (§6).
- **Causal soundness across the boundary (normative).** An op MUST be causally self-contained within its
  namespace: an RGA `ref` or tree `parent` MUST name a `target` in the **same** `ns`, and a
  cross-namespace reference is `ERR_SYNC_NS_LEAK` (`0x0A0A`). This keeps a sparse subscriber from needing
  ops outside its subscription to converge its own namespaces — the property that makes partial sync
  correct rather than merely partial.
- **Absence is not authority.** A replica not subscribed to a namespace makes **no** assertion about it
  (the capability-absence rule, §21.22): its silence is never read as "empty" or "deleted."

## 8. Multi-author capability (the generalization over §5.6)

§5.6 authorizes an op by **ambient MLS group membership** — every writer is a device of one owner, and
the op rides unsigned inside the encrypted group. The substrate authorizes an op by its **own COSE
signature** (§4.1), which decouples authorship from any shared secret and yields three deployment shapes
from one spec:

1. **Single-owner device cluster** (= §5.6). Every author key chains to the **same** `IK`; the admitted
   author set is exactly that identity's non-revoked `DeviceCert`s (§1.2). Evicting a device (`IK`-signed
   rotation, §1.5) drops it from the set and rejects its future ops — the §5.6 healing path.
2. **Closed multi-owner set.** Author keys chain to **different** `IK`s admitted by an explicit **member
   set** (an OR-Set of admitted `IK`s, itself a synced object governed by an admin-capability, §13.5) —
   a shared workspace of several identities.
3. **Open / permissionless namespace.** Any Identity may author; the replica applies an **admission
   policy** (rate/quota/reputation) rather than a membership gate, exactly as a Feeds holder does
   ([`FEEDS.md § 7`](FEEDS.md)). Conflict resolution is unchanged — determinism comes from the CRDT
   algebra and the HLC total order, not from who is allowed to write.

In all three, the **authorization check is the same**: an op is applied iff its signature verifies under
`hlc.author` (§4.1) **and** that author is admitted by the namespace's policy — `ERR_SYNC_AUTHOR_
UNAUTHORIZED` (`0x0A01`) otherwise. Because the author key is the HLC tiebreak (§3), determinism holds
across any author set: distinct authors never tie, so the merged state is identical everywhere regardless
of how many identities wrote it.

**Deniable content is barred from sync state (inherited, §5.6).** A `SyncOp` value MUST NOT embed a
deniable payload: durable, signed, replicated history is the opposite of repudiable, so a value that
carries deniable material is rejected (`ERR_SYNC_OP_INVALID`, `0x0A03`) — the §5.6 `embeds_deniable`
rule, carried forward.

---

## 9. Authorization and admission (summary)

| Deployment | Admitted authors | Gate | Eviction |
|------------|------------------|------|----------|
| Device cluster (§5.6) | one `IK`'s `DeviceCert`s | MLS membership + op signature | `IK`-signed device rotation (§1.5) |
| Closed multi-owner | a synced member-set of `IK`s | member-set + op signature | admin removes `IK` from member-set (§13.5) |
| Open namespace | any `IK` | admission policy (rate/quota) + op signature | policy deny (`0x0A0B`), never a takedown |

Op signature verification (§4.1) is **mandatory in every row** — the gate differs, the per-op
authenticity does not.

---

## 10. Conformance vectors (stubs)

These stubs follow the existing suite style ([`../conformance/`](../conformance/), §10, §22 vectors). Each
is a known-answer test to be pinned with byte-exact inputs/outputs when the substrate wire encoding is
frozen; the **construction recipe and expected result** are given now so an implementer can self-check.

| # | Name | Construction | Expected |
|---|------|--------------|----------|
| `SYNC-OP-01` | Op canonical encoding | `det_cbor(SyncOp{kind:3, ns:"", target:"a", field:"x", value:"v", hlc})` | byte-exact CBOR; re-decode round-trips; non-canonical input rejected |
| `SYNC-OP-02` | Op signature bind | `COSE_Sign1` over `SYNC-OP-01` under author key K, DS-tag `DMTAP-SYNC-v0/op` | verifies under K; a flipped byte ⇒ `0x0A02` |
| `SYNC-AUTH-01` | Unauthorized author | op signed by K′ whose `DeviceCert` is absent/revoked from the member-set | reject `0x0A01` |
| `SYNC-LWW-01` | LWW HLC winner | two `lww-set` on `(a,x)` with HLC h1<h2 | value of h2, on any apply order |
| `SYNC-LWW-02` | LWW exact-tie determinism | two `lww-set`, identical HLC, values `"m"`/`"n"` | larger `det_cbor(value)` wins, identical on both replicas |
| `SYNC-ORSET-01` | Add-wins | concurrent `set-add(e)` and `set-remove(e)` where remove's `observed` omits the concurrent add | `e` present |
| `SYNC-ORSET-02` | Future-add remove rejected | `set-remove` citing an add-tag with HLC > remove's HLC | reject `0x0A03` |
| `SYNC-DEATH-01` | Remove-wins domination | `death(redact)` at h1, concurrent `set-add` at h2>h1 | object **absent** (death dominates regardless of h2) |
| `SYNC-DEATH-02` | Tie fail-safe | `death` and `live` at identical HLC | `Deleted` wins (fail-safe) |
| `SYNC-PN-01` | Counter convergence | authors a,b: `+5(a)`, `−2(b)`, replay `+5(a)` | total `3`; replay is a no-op (max-per-author) |
| `SYNC-PN-02` | Foreign-entry reject | op from `a` mutating `P[b]` | reject `0x0A06` |
| `SYNC-RGA-01` | Concurrent insert order | two `seq-insert` same origin, ids h1<h2 | order = [h2, h1] (newer-first), identical on both replicas |
| `SYNC-RGA-02` | Insert after tombstone | `seq-remove(x)` then concurrent `seq-insert` with `ref=x` | insert resolves; sequence well-defined |
| `SYNC-TREE-01` | Concurrent-move cycle | `move(A→B)` and `move(B→A)`, HLC-ordered | later-HLC move applied, earlier skipped; tree acyclic; identical on both |
| `SYNC-SNAP-01` | Snapshot root determinism | two replicas at the same `covers` vector | identical `root`; mismatch ⇒ `0x0A09` |
| `SYNC-SNAP-02` | Fast-join equals replay | join via snapshot+post-ops vs full replay | byte-identical observable state |
| `SYNC-RECON-01` | Range-Merkle finds diff | two replicas differing in 1 op, range-fingerprint round | exactly the 1 differing op surfaced; equal ranges exchange no ops |
| `SYNC-NS-01` | Sparse scoping | caller subscribes `{x}`, responder holds `{x,y}` | only `ns=x` ops shipped |
| `SYNC-NS-02` | Cross-namespace ref rejected | RGA `ref` naming a target in another `ns` | reject `0x0A0A` |
| `SYNC-GC-01` | Stability-cut safety | tombstone below the cut dropped; a stale replica excluded from the cut | observable state unchanged; live replica with no watermark ⇒ no GC |

---

## 11. Security considerations / honest limits

1. **Determinism depends on canonical encoding.** If an implementation emits non-canonical CBOR or a
   non-`ext-value` value, two replicas can diverge. This is why §2.2 is a MUST and every value is
   restricted to `ext-value`; a violating op is rejected (`0x0A03`), never merged on a guess.
2. **A signing-key compromise can author under the identity.** An op is only as authentic as its author
   key and `DeviceCert` chain (§4.1). A compromised operational key can write ops until revoked (§1.5);
   the blast radius is the ops it could author in the interval, bounded by eviction (§8) — the ordinary
   endpoint residual (§6.6 item 3), now with the caveat that replicated CRDT history is durable, so a
   malicious write must be **superseded by a later op** (a compensating `lww-set`/`death`/`seq-remove`),
   not "deleted."
3. **Snapshots trade replay for trust unless verified.** A trusted-checkpoint snapshot (§6.1) trusts the
   signer for pre-`covers` history until backfilled. The deployment policy MUST be explicit; the residual
   is bounded because every post-`covers` op is independently verified and the next snapshot boundary
   surfaces divergence (`0x0A09`).
4. **Stability-cut liveness is a policy tradeoff.** Excluding a stale replica from the cut lets
   compaction proceed, but if that replica returns *after* GC it may lack a tombstone it needed — it then
   heals by snapshot bootstrap (§6.1), not by replaying dropped tombstones. This is the standard CRDT GC
   tradeoff (bounded storage vs. arbitrarily-late rejoin), disclosed, not hidden.
5. **The movable tree is the one non-join kind.** Its convergence relies on deterministic HLC-ordered
   replay (§4.8), not a pure per-op merge; an implementation that applies tree-moves out of order without
   the re-evaluation step will diverge. The conformance vector `SYNC-TREE-01` exists to catch exactly
   this.
6. **Metadata: authorship and timing are visible to co-authors.** Sync is not sealed-sender — every op
   carries its author and HLC, visible to every replica in the namespace (by design: multi-author
   convergence needs attributable ops). A product needing author-blind convergence is out of scope; that
   is a different problem than the one solved here.

## 12. Fail-closed rules this capability contributes (proposed `0x0A` block)

Registered additively under §21.14; mirrored into the §10.7 auditable set. The owning clause governs.

| Code | Name | Trigger | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `0x0A01` | `ERR_SYNC_AUTHOR_UNAUTHORIZED` | op author not admitted by the namespace policy (§8, §9) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0A02` | `ERR_SYNC_OP_SIG_INVALID` | `COSE_Sign1` fails under `hlc.author` / broken `DeviceCert` chain (§4.1) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0A03` | `ERR_SYNC_OP_INVALID` | non-`ext-value` value, future-add remove, embedded deniable payload, malformed op (§4) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0A04` | `ERR_SYNC_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` | op/snapshot carries a `v`/`suite` unsupported (§4.1, §6.1) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK — never guess |
| `0x0A05` | `ERR_SYNC_HLC_SKEW` | op `wall` outside the skew window (§3) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0A06` | `ERR_SYNC_COUNTER_FOREIGN` | a PN-counter op mutates another author's P/N entry (§4.6) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0A07` | `ERR_SYNC_SEQ_ORIGIN_MISSING` | RGA insert origin absent and the causal buffer overflows (§4.7) | DEFER_REQUESTS then ROTATE_RETRY |
| `0x0A08` | `ERR_SYNC_FRAME_CHAIN_BROKEN` | a `SyncFrame` op's `ref` back-link does not resolve to its predecessor (§4.1) | HALT_ALERT — publish conflicting frames as evidence |
| `0x0A09` | `ERR_SYNC_SNAPSHOT_ROOT_MISMATCH` | recomputed observable-state root ≠ `Snapshot.root` at the same `covers` (§6.1) | HALT_ALERT — divergence evidence |
| `0x0A0A` | `ERR_SYNC_NS_LEAK` | an op references a `target` in a different namespace (§7) | FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK |
| `0x0A0B` | `ERR_SYNC_ADMISSION_QUOTA` | an open-namespace admission limit (rate/quota) exceeded (§9) | DENY_POLICY — a policy deny, never a security gate, never a silent hole |

The §10.7.5 governing rule applies unchanged: a sync security-relevant failure is either refused (fail
closed) or surfaced as an explicit choice, never a silent degradation. New sync fail-closed rules MUST be
mirrored into §10.7.

## 13. Grounding

- **CRDT semantics** — `dmtap-clustersync` (§5.6 reference, `/Users/pc/code/vulos/envoir/crates/dmtap-clustersync`):
  OR-Set add-wins, LWW-by-HLC with encoded-value tiebreak, remove-wins death-certificate with the D3
  domination invariant, HLC total order `(wall, counter, author)`, stability-cut GC, hash-chained
  journal. The PN-counter, RGA sequence, and movable tree are **new** here (standard CRDT constructions:
  state-based PN-counter; Roh et al. RGA; Kleppmann highly-available replicated tree), added to complete
  the algebra.
- **Wire protocol** — flowstock stateless sync (`/Users/pc/code/vulos/flowstock`): `GET /sync/vector`,
  `POST /sync/pull`, `POST /sync/ops`, per-author `MAX(hlc)` version vector, symmetric push-then-pull
  round, idempotent oplog dedup, LWW-by-HLC + set-union movements, constant-time bearer auth fail-closed
  on empty secret. The substrate upgrades flowstock's JSON to deterministic CBOR and its trusted-network
  bearer auth to per-op COSE signatures for the multi-author case.
- **Range-based reconciliation** — the §5.6 `recon` module and the standard range-based set-reconciliation
  algorithm, operating over the HLC total order.
- **Snapshots & sparse sync** — new to the substrate; grounded in the §5.6 canonical-snapshot form and
  stability-cut, generalized to signed portable checkpoints and per-namespace scoping.

Independent implementations MUST be buildable from this document and [`IDENTITY.md`](IDENTITY.md) alone
(the flowstock test); the reference code above is an existence proof, not the standard, and where it and
this document disagree, this document governs.
