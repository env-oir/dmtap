# Adoption status — what each product implements today

> **Status:** informative, descriptive, non-normative. This is a **snapshot** (2026-07-19) of what each
> product's code actually does, read directly from each repository — not a conformance certification and
> not a roadmap commitment. It fixes no wire bytes and defines nothing; [`IDENTITY.md`](IDENTITY.md),
> [`FEEDS.md`](FEEDS.md), [`SYNC.md`](SYNC.md), and [`ROLES.md`](ROLES.md) remain the sole normative
> statements of what each capability *is*. Where this document says a product is behind or diverges from
> them, the capability document is right and this document is describing a gap, not a disagreement. See
> [`BINDINGS.md`](BINDINGS.md) for the engineering plan to close these gaps by binding to one shared core
> rather than by five more independent rewrites.

**Status legend** (one per cell): **to-spec** = speaks the capability's actual bytes/wire, verified or
directly inspected; **independent** = implements the *function* with its own bytes — not interoperable with
another to-spec implementation of the same capability; **partial** = a real but incomplete attempt (a
stub, a subset of the algebra, a missing sub-role); **minimal** = a narrow building block exists (e.g. a
bare keypair) but not enough of the capability to call it adopted; **n/a** = not attempted, and there is no
particular reason it should be, given what the product is; **not built** = the capability is meaningfully
relevant to the product but nothing exists yet.

\* Types (`PubManifest`/`PubAnnounce`/`FeedEntry`/`FeedHead`, chain verification) exist in
`dmtap-core::pubobj`, but the `pub_vectors.json` generator's own metadata still describes the Rust core as
not implementing the PUB extension — it has not been run against the frozen vectors yet. See §2 below.

\** Uses the correct open standard (Web Push/VAPID) but the payload carries a title/body, so it is not the
content-free wake the spec requires — see §2.

\*** vidmesh's own key-rotation-with-recovery-precedence design was independently built, then adopted
*into* [`IDENTITY.md § 5.1`](IDENTITY.md#51-informative--contest-window-finality-for-the-zero-dns--zero-kt-floor)
as an informative note — convergent by influence, not by wire compatibility.

\**** Reference implementation of §22 with one closed gap in the working tree (as of this writing,
uncommitted) and one open gap (DeviceCert chains) — see §2.

## 2. Per-product detail

### envoir — `/Users/pc/code/vulos/envoir`

The reference core (see [`BINDINGS.md`](BINDINGS.md) for the full crate layout).

- **Identity — to-spec.** `dmtap-core::identity` implements `IdentityKey`/`Identity`/`DeviceCert`/
  `RecoveryPolicy`/`KeyRotation`/`MoveRecord` directly; `keyname` implements the 8-word key-name; `kt`
  implements the RFC 6962 transparency objects. This crate *is* one of the documents' own grounding
  references.
- **Feeds & Blobs — to-spec, pending vector verification.** `dmtap-core::pubobj` implements
  `PubManifest`/`PubAnnounce`/`FeedEntry`/`FeedHead`/`verify_feed_chain`/`check_anti_rollback`. **What
  would close the asterisk:** wire `dmtap-core` into the `pub_vectors.json` conformance run and update the
  vector generator's metadata once it passes — until then this is "implemented" on inspection, not yet
  proven byte-identical to the frozen vectors.
- **Sync — to-spec.** `dmtap-clustersync` (§5.6 single-owner profile: `Cluster`/`Replica`/`ClusterState`/
  `OrSet`/`LwwMap`/`DeathReg`/`Journal`/`range_fingerprint`) and `dmtap-sync` (the substrate's multi-author
  six-kind algebra, COSE-signed ops) are the crates [`SYNC.md`](SYNC.md) grounds itself in.
- **Roles — partial.** `dmtap-p2p` gives real libp2p implementations of announce/resolve (Kademlia),
  signaling (DCUtR), and circuit relay (Circuit Relay v2) — to-spec for those three sub-roles. Mailbox and
  a servable cache/pin surface were not confirmed to exist in this survey (`node/src/pubserve.rs` exists
  and its name suggests a pub-serving path, but its wire shape was not verified). **What would close the
  gap:** confirm or build the mailbox role and verify `pubserve.rs` actually serves the
  `/.well-known/dmtap-pub/*` surface per [`FEEDS.md § 5.1`](FEEDS.md#51-the-well-known-gateway-2251).
- **Wake — not built.** No VAPID/Web Push/UnifiedPush code found anywhere in the workspace. **What would
  close the gap:** implement `PushSubscription`/`WakePing` per [`ROLES.md § 8`](ROLES.md#8-wake--content-free-sender-blind-push-capability-⑤-profile-of-49) — envoir has no wake path today, so this is greenfield, not a rewrite.

### vulos — `/Users/pc/code/vulos/vulos`

The main suite (control plane, OS, apps). Two largely disconnected identity/sync stories live in this one
repo — the ordinary product auth path, and a separately-designed peering subsystem that is far closer to
the substrate's shape without speaking its bytes.

- **Identity — independent, two layers.** (1) The primary auth path is session/OAuth-based, not
  keypair-rooted, though device-level Ed25519 + management-CA `DeviceCert`-like certs exist for offline
  first-boot claiming (`INTEG-SEC-01`) — own format, not the DMTAP wire. (2) `backend/services/peering/
  identity.go`/`identity_lifecycle.go` implements a real Ed25519 keypair identity (`vula:ed25519:<pubkey>`)
  with rotation/revocation/recovery and TOFU/anchor trust — conceptually a close cousin of §1/§3, wire-
  incompatible (own cert format, not COSE/DMTAP CBOR). **What would move it:** re-encode the peering
  identity objects as DMTAP `Identity`/`DeviceCert` CBOR and adopt the 8-word key-name as the durable
  handle instead of the bespoke `vula:` scheme.
- **Feeds & Blobs — independent.** `backend/services/peering/feeds.go` implements a real signed,
  hash-chained (`prev_hash`/`content_hash`), append-only feed with access-level gating — structurally a
  cousin of `FeedHead`/`FeedEntry`, but its own JSON wire, no content-addressed chunking, no §22 manifest.
  **What would move it:** adopt `PubManifest`/`PubAnnounce`/`FeedHead`/`FeedEntry` CDDL and BLAKE3
  DS-tagged addressing in place of the bespoke JSON chain.
- **Sync — independent, two unrelated engines.** (1) `internal/multiinstance/appsync.go` +
  `internal/fabric/fabric.go`: syncs exactly one table (`app_registry`) — LWW on version/timestamp + OR-set
  on installed flag — over **LAN-only** mDNS-discovered JSON changesets with a shared-secret auth header.
  No HLC, no version-vector/Merkle reconciliation, no RGA/tree. (2) `services/peering/collab.go`: real-time
  document collaboration via **Yjs**, a third-party CRDT unrelated to DMTAP's op algebra, relayed as opaque
  binary over WebSocket. Neither is DMTAP-SYNC; they are not even the same engine as each other. **What
  would move fabric:** widen it past a single table and swap its custom changeset format for
  `dmtap-sync` ops (see [`BINDINGS.md § 6`](BINDINGS.md#6-migration-path-per-product-optional-per-capability-nothing-forced)
  for the pure-Go binding tradeoff this repo specifically carries).
- **Roles — independent.** `peering/relay.go` is a genuine Ed25519-signed deposit/pickup/ack mailbox with
  TTL — structurally the mailbox role, own auth-header wire format (`Vula-Relay <id>.<ts>.<sig>`), not
  `LocationRecord`/DMTAP's mailbox wire. `peering/discovery.go` is a plain REST directory lookup against
  vulos.org, not key-addressed announce/resolve. No circuit-relay/signaling in this repo (that lives in
  vulos-relay). **What would move it:** re-key `discovery.go` to resolve by `IK` instead of an account
  directory lookup, and re-wire `relay.go`'s auth header as a `DeviceCert`-chained signature.
- **Wake — independent, and not content-free.** `internal/webpush/webpush.go` (`PUSH-CELL-01`) is real,
  sovereign, RFC 8291-compliant Web Push/VAPID — the box holds its own VAPID keys, SSRF-guarded, correctly
  using an open standard. But the payload (`Payload{Title, Body, Tag, Source, URL}`) carries a
  human-visible title/body — it is a **push notification**, not the spec's content-free wake-and-fetch
  hint. This is a legitimate, different design goal (rendering a notification vs. silently triggering a
  sync), not a bug, but it is not what [`ROLES.md § 8`](ROLES.md#8-wake--content-free-sender-blind-push-capability-⑤-profile-of-49)
  defines as Wake. **What would move it:** add a second, genuinely content-free `WakePing` path
  alongside the existing notification push, rather than repurposing the notification payload.

### vulos-relay — `/Users/pc/code/vulos/vulos-relay`

- **Identity — minimal.** The commercial tunnel core is bearer-token/`AccountID`-based, not key-addressed
  at all. The separate rendezvous subsystem (below) does Ed25519-sign its writes, but that is Roles usage,
  not a general Identity capability (no `DeviceCert`, no naming ladder). **What would move it:** adopt
  `IK`/`DeviceCert` as the rendezvous subsystem's identity rather than a bare signing key.
- **Feeds & Blobs — to-spec.** `tunnel/pubcache/*` is a literal §22 implementation: BLAKE3 domain-separated
  Merkle addressing (`"DMTAP-PUB-v0/manifest"`), served at `/.well-known/dmtap-pub/{announce,manifest,
  chunk,feed}` with correct immutable-vs-mutable caching. This is the most spec-faithful code found in
  either vulos repo. Nothing to close here.
- **Sync — not built.** No CRDT/HLC code found in this repo.
- **Roles — independent.** `tunnel/rendezvous/*` implements key-addressed announce/resolve/signal/mailbox +
  ICE, Ed25519-signed, content-blind, standalone from the OS repo — structurally faithful to the role
  definitions in [`ROLES.md`](ROLES.md) but its own wire protocol, not literal `LocationRecord` CBOR. The
  commercial tunnel core itself (bearer-token WSS+yamux) is a separate product surface, not a spec role.
  **What would move it:** re-encode `rendezvous`'s records as DMTAP `LocationRecord`/mailbox objects; the
  role *shape* is already right, only the bytes differ.
- **Wake — not built.** No VAPID/webpush code found in this repo. (Unrelated honesty gap, noted for
  completeness: SNI-passthrough mail is also still not built here, per the 2026-07-17 audit — this affects
  none of the five substrate capabilities and is not part of this matrix.)

### ofisi — `/Users/pc/code/vulos/ofisi`

- **Identity — minimal.** No per-user keypair is used as sync/session identity; the P2P room model is
  **capability-by-shared-key** (an invite link embeds `{roomId, roomKey, cap}`, HKDF-derived AES-GCM +
  HMAC) — "link holders," explicitly not per-identity, by the code's own doc comment. Ed25519 exists
  elsewhere (`backend/signing/crypto.go`, sharelink signing) but for content-sealing, unrelated to sync
  identity.
- **Feeds & Blobs — n/a.** No content-addressed public object or publish mechanism exists or is implied by
  what ofisi is (a live collaborative editor).
- **Sync — independent.** Genuine **Yjs** CRDT (`yjs`, `y-prosemirror`), not custom, not Automerge. Wire is
  Yjs's own binary update/state-vector format, base64-wrapped in a JSON envelope (`{y:1, u:"..."}`) — no
  CBOR, no COSE, no HLC total order, no version-vector/Merkle reconciliation (Yjs's own state-vector diff
  substitutes for it). **What would move it:** per [`BINDINGS.md § 6`](BINDINGS.md#6-migration-path-per-product-optional-per-capability-nothing-forced),
  full conformance would mean ripping out Yjs's CRDT engine entirely (it is load-bearing through the whole
  editor stack) — unrealistic as a wholesale migration. The realistic partial move is wrapping Yjs's
  opaque update bytes inside a COSE-signed `dmtap-sync` envelope (adopting the authenticity layer, not the
  algebra).
- **Roles — independent.** A vendored `@vulos/relay-client` (`FabricClient`) provides signaling, rendezvous,
  WebRTC circuit-fallback relay, and presence — conceptually close to the Roles substrate, but its own
  SDK/protocol, not DMTAP key-addressed announce/resolve.
- **Wake — n/a.** No VAPID/web-push/UnifiedPush code found; nothing in ofisi's design implies it needs one
  independent of whatever the host product (Workspace/Meet) already provides.

### flowstock — `/Users/pc/code/vulos/flowstock`

- **Identity — minimal.** `backend/internal/store/identity.go` gives every node a per-node Ed25519 keypair
  used to sign op batches, but there is no naming ladder above it (no DNS, no KT, no `DeviceCert`, no
  8-word key-name) — a bare signing key, not the Identity capability.
- **Feeds & Blobs — n/a.** Not attempted; nothing in flowstock's design (inventory sync) implies it.
- **Sync — independent, partial algebra.** This is the repo [`SYNC.md`](SYNC.md) itself grounds its wire
  *shape* in, and it is a real, working stateless sync protocol: `GET/POST /api/sync/{vector,pull,ops}`,
  an HLC (`"{ms:013d}-{counter:04x}-{node}"`) matching the spec's grounding note exactly, a per-author
  `MAX(hlc)` version vector. But it is **not** byte-conformant: bodies are **JSON**, not deterministic
  CBOR; signatures are a **plain hex Ed25519 signature over `json.Marshal(ops)`**, not a `COSE_Sign1`
  envelope; transport auth is **bearer-secret-primary** with key-based auth as an optional add-on the
  code's own comments call "a documented next step, not forced here." It supports **2 of the 6** CRDT
  kinds — whole-row LWW and an insert-only/set-union ledger (explicitly *not* a PN-counter, by the schema's
  own comment) — with no OR-Set, death-certificate, RGA, or movable-tree. **What would move it:** switch
  the wire body to deterministic CBOR with `COSE_Sign1` envelopes, make key-based auth the only path
  (retire the bearer-secret fallback), and add the four missing CRDT kinds — see
  [`BINDINGS.md § 6`](BINDINGS.md#6-migration-path-per-product-optional-per-capability-nothing-forced) for
  the binding path that would deliver all of this as a swap-in rather than a rewrite.
- **Roles — n/a.** Not attempted; flowstock has no reachability/relay/mailbox problem of its own (it syncs
  over a network it doesn't need to traverse NAT for in the same sense a P2P messaging product does).
- **Wake — n/a.** No push/wake mechanism, and nothing in flowstock's design implies it needs one.

### vidmesh — `/Users/pc/code/vulos/vidmesh`

A substantial, independently-specified Rust protocol (its own `spec/000-007*.md`) that is *convergent in
design* with the substrate in several places, and explicitly aware of it.

- **Identity — independent (design already adopted upstream).** Real Ed25519 keypair identity plus a
  rotation log with recovery-over-signing contest-window finality (`crates/vidmesh-kernel/src/identity.rs`,
  its own `spec/002` §4). No `DeviceCert` chain, DNS binding, key transparency, or 8-word name. Notably,
  this exact fork-resolution design was independently built here *first* and then adopted into
  [`IDENTITY.md § 5.1`](IDENTITY.md#51-informative--contest-window-finality-for-the-zero-dns--zero-kt-floor)
  as an informative note — convergent by influence on the spec, not by wire compatibility with it.
- **Feeds & Blobs — independent, convergence founder-gated.** Hash is **BLAKE3-256**, matching the spec's
  algorithm choice — but the raw blob hash and record id carry **no DS-tag and no multihash prefix**
  (unlike DMTAP-PUB's `0x1e`-prefixed, `"DMTAP-PUB-v0/manifest"`-tagged tree), and the Merkle split rule
  differs from RFC 6962. A `Hint` type exists (`crates/vidmesh-kernel/src/kinds/content.rs:32`) but as a
  bare `Hint(u64, String)` tuple, not the 4-variant `https`/`torrent-v2`/`relay-blob`/`bundle` enum the
  substrate's advisory hint registry defines (the enumeration exists only in vidmesh's own prose spec, not
  its types). A `GET /blob/{id}/proof?chunk=i` endpoint returns a CBOR Merkle audit path — same idea as
  [`FEEDS.md § 5.3`](FEEDS.md#53-optional--chunk-tree-range-proofs-additive-proposal), own encoder and own
  array shape. Content is signed, but through one universal `Record` envelope, not a dedicated
  `PubManifest`/`PubAnnounce` — and critically, **there is no Feeds primitive at all**: no monotonic `seq`,
  no `prev` hash-chain, no fork detection (vidmesh's own docs note this as a gap). A full decision document
  exists in-repo (`docs/DMTAP-CONVERGENCE.md`, mirrored at `apps/site/docs/dmtap-convergence.md`)
  recommending re-basing vidmesh's video layer as the [§24 Video/Media profile](../24-video-profile.md);
  `DECISIONS.md` marks this **founder-gated** on three preconditions (founder confirms direction, §24 is
  targetable, envoir's §22 Rust implementation is a consumable dependency) — nothing has been actioned yet.
  **What would move it:** per [`BINDINGS.md § 6`](BINDINGS.md#6-migration-path-per-product-optional-per-capability-nothing-forced),
  fold in the DS-tag + multihash prefix, switch to the RFC-6962 split, adopt `PubManifest`/`PubAnnounce`/
  `FeedHead`/`FeedEntry`, and serve at `/.well-known/dmtap-pub/*` — all Rust-to-Rust, no cross-language
  binding needed, since this would be a direct `dmtap-core` dependency.
- **Sync — n/a.** No CRDT/HLC/vector-clock code or dependency anywhere; "sync" here is flood-fill gossip
  dedup over WebSocket, a different problem (event propagation, not convergent state) than
  [`SYNC.md`](SYNC.md) addresses.
- **Roles — partial.** Relay is a full, working crate. Cache/pin is explicitly marked
  `SCAFFOLD(phase-8)` and non-functional in the code itself
  (`crates/vidmesh-node/src/pinning.rs`). Mailbox has zero hits anywhere in the repo. **What would move
  it:** finish the scaffolded cache/pin path and build a mailbox role, or fold both into the §24
  convergence work if/when it proceeds.
- **Wake — not built.** No wake/webpush/APNs/FCM code anywhere in the repo.

### whatsacc — `/Users/pc/code/whatsacc`

(Note: not under `/Users/pc/code/vulos/` as originally expected — it lives at `/Users/pc/code/whatsacc`. A
similarly-named `/Users/pc/code/exo/whatsacc-mono` is an unrelated project.) A mature chat-driven physical
gate access-control product (Go gateway + controller agent + Tauri app). Its own `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 marks
a DMTAP channel adapter as **"Sketch only — no seam interface, no wire format, no schedule."** Its authors'
own assessment is the right one to record here: this product has essentially no decentralized-substrate
surface today, by design, not by oversight.

- **Identity — minimal.** Real per-device Ed25519 keypairs (`controller/internal/identity/identity.go`,
  `gateway/internal/keys/keys.go`) with TOFU gateway-key pinning — a real building block, but no
  `DeviceCert`, DNS binding, transparency, or naming ladder above it.
- **Feeds & Blobs — n/a.** Its "audit log" is a plain, unsigned, unchained SQL table — not attempting
  content-addressing or a feed structure, and there's no reason a gate-access log needs to be a public
  feed.
- **Sync — n/a.** It has a well-built Ed25519+JCS signed-command envelope with nonce/replay protection
  (`gateway/internal/keys/envelope.go`) — adjacent in spirit to a COSE-signed op, but it is point-to-point
  RPC (open a gate, revoke a badge), not CRDT state convergence. There is no shared state to converge here.
- **Roles — n/a.** Its "relay" is a GPIO hardware relay (the physical gate latch) and its "mdns" is plain
  LAN discovery — name collisions with DMTAP terms, not related implementations.
- **Wake — n/a.** Notifications ride third-party WhatsApp/Slack push, which is out of scope for a
  DMTAP-native wake mechanism and not a gap this product needs closed.

### kerf-pub — `/Users/pc/code/exo/kerf/packages/kerf-pub`

The named reference implementation of §22 ([`FEEDS.md § 6`](FEEDS.md#6-reference-implementation--kerf-pub-proves-the-http-test)).
Its actual current state is **better than that document's text**, which had gone stale.

- **Identity — minimal.** A local Ed25519 keypair signs announces/heads, but `signer == pub` is
  hard-enforced everywhere (`identity.py`, `objects.py`) — no `DeviceCert` chain support yet, so it is not
  adopting the Identity capability beyond a bare signer key.
- **Feeds & Blobs — to-spec, with one closed gap (uncommitted) and one open gap.** The wire encoding is
  genuine deterministic **CBOR** matching the CDDL key numbers exactly (not JSON), and all five
  `/.well-known/dmtap-pub/*` endpoints exist in `router.py`. The hash scheme has **moved to BLAKE3-256**
  (`0x1e`) as the write path in the working tree — `SHA2-256` (`0x12`) is kept only for reading
  pre-cutover objects — with a dependency-free BLAKE3 fallback (`blake3_pure.py`) when the compiled wheel
  isn't available; this migration vendors and byte-diffs identically against this repository's own
  `pub_vectors.json`. **As of this writing that migration is uncommitted** (`hashing.py`, `client.py`,
  `__init__.py` modified; `blake3_pure.py`, the vector tests, and the vendored vectors untracked) — the last
  committed state is still the SHA2-256 build [`FEEDS.md § 6`](FEEDS.md#6-reference-implementation--kerf-pub-proves-the-http-test)
  describes, and `cid.py`'s docstring is now stale prose describing the old default. `DeviceCert` chains
  remain genuinely unimplemented (`signer == pub` hard-enforced, with explicit code comments saying so).
  **What would close it:** commit the BLAKE3 migration, and implement `DeviceCert` chain verification per
  [`FEEDS.md § 4.2`](FEEDS.md#42-the-pubannounce-kind-0x40-223) step 4.
- **Sync — n/a.** Not attempted; kerf-pub is a Feeds/Blobs (+ Wake) server, not a state-sync engine.
- **Roles — to-spec, cache/pin only.** The `/.well-known/dmtap-pub/*` gateway itself **is** the cache/pin
  role ([`ROLES.md § 6`](ROLES.md#6-cache--pin--serve-content-addressed-objects-profile-of-225-55)),
  correctly implemented (immutable `Cache-Control`/`ETag` on the four content-addressed endpoints). No
  other role (announce/resolve, signaling, circuit relay, mailbox) is attempted, and none is implied by
  what kerf-pub is.
- **Wake — independent.** kerf-pub ships its own Wake extension (VAPID keys, `router.py`'s
  `wake-key`/`subscribe` routes) — a real, working use of the correct open standard (Web Push/VAPID), but
  with its own subscription/registration endpoint shapes rather than the `PushSubscription`/`WakePing`
  object forms [`ROLES.md § 8.1`](ROLES.md#81-the-two-objects-profile-of-491-18556) defines. **What would
  move it:** adopt the `IK`-signed `PushSubscription` and content-free, RFC-8291-sealed `WakePing` object
  shapes precisely, in place of its own subscribe endpoint's payload.

---

## 3. What this matrix says about the strategic goal

The premise this survey was run to test — "~5 hand-rolled sync engines, one shared implementation should
retire them" — holds up, with more nuance than the premise implied:

- **Sync is genuinely fragmented**, and each fragment is a real, working, independently-correct design:
  flowstock's HLC+oplog (the spec's own wire-shape grounding, yet not byte-conformant itself), ofisi's Yjs,
  vulos's fabric LWW/OR-set (LAN-only, one table) and its separate Yjs-based collab path. No two of these
  four can talk to each other today. This is exactly the gap [`BINDINGS.md`](BINDINGS.md) is written to
  close — not by asking four teams to rewrite four times, but by giving Sync one compiled core and four
  thin bindings.
- **Feeds & Blobs is closer to converged than expected.** vulos-relay's `pubcache` and kerf-pub are both
  already at or near to-spec, independently. The gap here is not fragmentation so much as reach: two
  products have it, most don't need it, and vidmesh's convergence is a real, drafted, founder-gated plan
  rather than an open question.
- **Roles is the most consistently "right shape, wrong bytes" capability** — vulos's peering relay,
  vulos-relay's rendezvous, and ofisi's `FabricClient` are all structurally faithful, independent
  reinventions of announce/resolve/mailbox/relay. This is the capability where a shared binding would
  probably require the least behavioral change per product, only a wire-format swap.
- **Wake is the least attempted and the most subtly wrong where it exists.** vulos's cellpush is a correct,
  sovereign VAPID implementation for the wrong job (it wants to render a notification, not fire a
  content-free hint) — a good reminder that "uses the right open standard" and "implements this capability"
  are different claims, worth keeping distinct in future audits.
