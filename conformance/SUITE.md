# DMTAP Conformance Test-Case Catalog

This is the **normative test-case catalog** referenced by spec §10.3 — the *operational
definition of compatibility*. An implementation, **in any language**, is DMTAP-conformant at a
level (§10.3: Core / Private / Groups&Files / Legacy / Clients / Auth) **iff** it produces the
expected result for every `MUST` case at that level (and the cases of every level it composes).
"DMTAP-compatible" means "passes this suite," not "resembles the reference" (§10.3, §10.4).

The machine-readable form of this catalog is [`suite.json`](suite.json); the byte-exact inputs it
drives are [`vectors/vectors.json`](vectors/vectors.json) (see [`README.md`](README.md) for the
runner contract and provenance). This `.md` is the human-readable, clause-cross-referenced twin of
`suite.json`: the two carry the **same case ids** and MUST stay in sync.

## How to read a case

Each case has:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **id** | Stable identifier, `DMTAP-<CATEGORY>-<NN>`. Never reused. |
| **level** | The §10.3 level it belongs to (Core, Private, Groups&Files, Legacy, Clients, Auth). |
| **req** | `MUST` or `SHOULD` (RFC 2119). A level passes only if every `MUST` at that level passes. |
| **clause** | The exact normative spec clause (§-ref) the case pins. |
| **checks** | What behaviour is asserted. |
| **input** | A **vector id** in `vectors.json` (or, for the `PUB`/`CAD` categories, `vectors/pub_vectors.json` — see those sections), an inline **self-contained construction** (bytes given here), or a **construction** described from other vectors. |
| **expect** | The required outcome: `match` (recompute a KAT and get the committed answer), `accept` (validation passes), or `reject` + the **§21 error code** the reject maps to. |
| **status** | `vectored` (byte-backed by `vectors.json` or `pub_vectors.json`), `self-contained` (bytes given inline, reference-independent), `construction-todo` (recipe given; byte-exact vector still to be generated), or `manual-attestation` (a client-UX, in-product-disclosure or deployment/process MUST with **no wire bytes to recompute** — §22.7's publish-consent disclosures, §4.4.10a's Bootstrap degradation disclosure and no-anonymity-claim rule, §7.11.4/§9.11's gateway posture, §7.1b's process/privilege separation; verified by implementer/deployment review, not by a runner. A vector is **not** invented for these: fabricating bytes would assert a fact the protocol does not carry). |

**Outcome vocabulary.** `match` = the operation is a deterministic known-answer test; recompute
it over the fixed input and the result MUST equal the committed `expected`. `accept` / `reject` =
the operation is a validation predicate; a conforming node MUST accept (resp. reject) the input,
and on `reject` MUST map it to the named §21 error code with that code's `Action` disposition
(DROP_SILENT / DEFER_REQUESTS / FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK / HALT_ALERT / ACK_DEDUP …).

The 46 vectored + 6 self-contained cases (**52**) are fully machine-runnable **today** from
`vectors.json` / `pub_vectors.json` + the inline bytes here, with **no reference implementation
required**. They pin the entire deterministic, security-critical Core spine — canonical CBOR,
content addressing, the two MOTE signature preimages (§18.9.1/§18.9.2), Ed25519 (with RFC 8032
cross-checks), the 8-word key-name, safety numbers, suite fail-closed — **and, as of this wave, the
full DMTAP-PUB manifest/announce/feed KAT set** (§22.2/§22.3/§22.4: plaintext chunk hashing +
DS-tagged Merkle root, the announce and feed-head signing preimages, `announce_id`, the prev-chain,
type-incompatibility with sealed manifests, the same-author supersede rule, and feed anti-rollback
incl. the idempotent-refetch and fork/equivocation branches). The 137 `construction-todo` cases give
the exact recipe and expected §21 error for every remaining normative branch (the full §2.7
pipeline, identity/KT fail-closed, the higher levels, the wave-2 hardening families —
`DENIABLE`/`ORG`/`KTV1`/`ATTEST` — the `PROFILE` display-data guards, the pluggable-resolver guards
(`RESOLVE`), the optional `PUSH` wake-signaling guards, the `FILE` durability guards
`DMTAP-FILE-05`–`-09`, the wave-6 anti-drift families below
(`MIXPROF`/`FLEET`/`GUARD`/`LOC`/`FLOOR`/`FAILCLASS`/`GWROLE`), the remaining `PUB` fail-closed rows
not yet vectored, and the profile-level
`CAD` and `VIDEO` checklists); each becomes byte-backed when the corresponding subsystem gains a fixed-input KAT
(see README "Coverage vs. deferred"). The five `manual-attestation` cases are the MUSTs with **no
wire bytes to recompute** — `DMTAP-PUB-21` (§22.7 publish consent), `DMTAP-MIXPROF-01`/`-02` (the
Bootstrap profile's in-product disclosure and its prohibition on claiming anonymity, §4.4.10a
constraints 1–2), and `DMTAP-GWROLE-02`/`-03` (the gateway's user-facing posture, §7.11.4/§9.11, and
its process/privilege separation, §7.1b) — each verified by implementer/deployment review rather than
by a runner. **Fabricating byte vectors for them would assert a fact the protocol does not carry**;
attestation is the honest status, not a placeholder for a vector that could exist. **Sync status:**
`SUITE.md` and
[`suite.json`](suite.json) are **in sync** — both carry the same **194** case ids (the wave-2
`DENIABLE`/`KTV1` families, the `PROFILE` cases, the optional `PUSH` cases, the `FILE` durability
cases, the wave-3 `SYNC` (device-cluster), `ALIAS`, `GWALIAS`, and `RESOLVE` families, the
wave-4 `PUB`/`CAD`, wave-5 `VIDEO`, and wave-6
`MIXPROF`/`FLEET`/`GUARD`/`LOC`/`FLOOR`/`FAILCLASS`/`GWROLE` families are all mirrored into
`suite.json`). The changed deniable objects
(§5.2.1 dedicated-`idk`) are still to be re-vectored when the reference regenerates `vectors.json`.

> All 46 vectored cases correspond one-for-one to entries in `vectors.json` (34 cases / 33 of its
> 68 vectors — several vectors drive more than one case; the remaining 35 are pre-generated for
> construction-todo families not yet wired to a case) or `pub_vectors.json` (12 cases / all 15 of
> its vectors — several `PUB` cases reference more than one `pub_vectors.json` entry). No case
> references a vector entry that does not exist in its file; see
> [Vector cross-reference](#vector-cross-reference).

## Core level

Core is the interoperability floor (§10.3): Identity (§1), MOTE (§2), naming + TOFU + fail-closed
KT (§3), delivery + `deliver`/`ack` (§4), MLS 1:1 (§5), recipient policy incl. cold-sender
challenge gating (§9). A production mail node MUST also implement **Private** (§10.3). Every Core
crypto/encoding case below is a prerequisite the higher levels inherit.

### CBOR — deterministic canonical encoding (§18.1.1, §18.1.2)

| DMTAP-CBOR-06 | MUST | §18.1.1(1) | reject indefinite-length item | inline `0x9fff` (indefinite array + break) | reject → `ERR_MALFORMED_OBJECT` (0x020D) | self-contained |

| DMTAP-CBOR-12 | MUST | §18.1.2 | a decoder of a **signed** object rejects any unknown integer key `≥ 64` (fail closed, so the signing preimage stays unambiguous) | construction: take `cbor_payload`, insert key `64` (`0x1840`) `=> 0`, re-sort keys | reject → `ERR_MALFORMED_OBJECT` (0x020D) | construction-todo |

> Note: an **unsigned** object MAY ignore unknown keys `≥ 64` (§18.1.2); DMTAP-CBOR-12 asserts the
> *signed*-object fail-closed rule specifically. `Headers.ext` text-keyed extension is the only
> text-key surface (§18.3.6) and is out of scope for the integer-key rules above.

### VAL — the §2.7 ordered recipient-validation pipeline

The full ordered pipeline (§2.7), each step mapped to its authoritative §21.4 disposition. Steps
2, 3 and 8's positive path are already byte-backed by ADDR-05/06, PRE-02 and PRE-03; the remaining
branches give the exact reject code and disposition and are `construction-todo` (they need a full
sealed `Envelope`/`Payload` fixture, which is non-deterministic to *seal* — see README "deferred").

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-VAL-01 | MUST | §2.7 step 1, §10.1 | unknown `v`/`suite` rejected **first**, before any crypto | construction: `Envelope` with `v=1` (or unknown `suite`) | reject → `ERR_UNKNOWN_VERSION_OR_SUITE` (0x0201), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-02 | MUST | §2.7 step 2 | `id` mismatch dropped before decryption | (byte-backed by DMTAP-ADDR-06) | reject → `ERR_BAD_CONTENT_ADDRESS` (0x0202), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-03 | MUST | §2.7 step 3 | `sender_sig` failure dropped (cheap, pre-decryption) | construction: `mote_sender_sig` fixture with one sig bit flipped | reject → `ERR_BAD_SENDER_SIG` (0x0203), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-04 | MUST | §2.7 step 4 | `to` that does not resolve to this node/group is dropped | construction: `Envelope.to = KeyTag(other key)` | reject → `ERR_UNRESOLVED_TO` (0x0204), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-05 | MUST | §2.7 step 6, §2.7a, §9 | a cold sender's **forged/invalid** `challenge` is discarded silently, **not** acked | construction: `Envelope` from cold sender, tampered `ChallengeResponse` | reject → `ERR_CHALLENGE_INVALID_FORGED` (0x0205 → §21.10 0x0703), DROP_SILENT, no ack | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-06 | MUST | §2.7 step 6, §2.7a | a cold sender with **absent/under-threshold** proof is **deferred to the requests area**, rate-limited, and **NOT acked** (deferred = no ack) | construction: cold-sender `Envelope`, `challenge` absent | reject → `ERR_CHALLENGE_ABSENT_INSUFFICIENT` (0x0206 → §21.10 0x0701/0x0702), DEFER_REQUESTS, no ack | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-07 | MUST | §2.7 step 7 | ciphertext that fails to decrypt is dropped | construction: `Envelope` with corrupt `ciphertext` (address recomputed to keep step 2 valid) | reject → `ERR_DECRYPT_FAILURE` (0x0207), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-08 | MUST | §2.7 step 8 | `Payload.sig` failure ⇒ **discard silently and do NOT ack** (fail closed) | construction: sealed `Payload` with tampered `sig` | reject → `ERR_PAYLOAD_SIG_INVALID` (0x0208), DROP_SILENT, no ack | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-09 | MUST | §2.7 step 8, §3.4 | decrypted `from` that mismatches the pinned identity ⇒ security warning, MUST NOT silently repin | construction: known-contact `Envelope`, `Payload.from` ≠ pinned | reject → `ERR_FROM_PIN_MISMATCH` (0x0209), HALT_ALERT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-10 | MUST | §2.7 step 8, §1.3 | **suite-ratchet**: `Envelope.suite` **below** the contact's pinned high-water-mark is a downgrade ⇒ requests area + warning; MUST NOT accept, MUST NOT ratchet the high-water-mark down | construction: pinned contact HWM=`0x02`, inbound `Envelope.suite=0x01` | reject → `ERR_SUITE_DOWNGRADE` (0x020F), DEFER_REQUESTS + USER_WARN | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VAL-11 | MUST | §2.6, §21.4 | a duplicate `id` already held is **acked** immediately without re-processing | construction: re-deliver an already-stored `id` | accept → `STATUS_DUPLICATE_ID` (0x020E), ACK_DEDUP | construction-todo |

| DMTAP-VAL-13 | MUST | §2.3, §10.1 | a `kind` the node cannot validate is ignored and **MUST NOT be acked** | construction: `Envelope.kind = 0x40` (reserved) unimplemented | reject → `ERR_KIND_UNKNOWN` (0x020A), IGNORE_NO_ACK | construction-todo |

### IDENT — identity / KT / naming fail-closed (§1.3, §3.3, §3.5)

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |

## Private level (§4.4, §6)

Core + mixnet (Sphinx + directory + 3-hop stratified paths + key-epoch rotation) + sealed sender +
cover traffic + anti-active-adversary mechanisms + fail-closed no-downgrade + privacy tiers. A
**production** mail node MUST implement Private (§10.3): `private` is the standing default tier
(§4.6). No byte-exact vectors exist yet (Sphinx uses fresh randomness; see README "deferred");
each case gives the normative check and error.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-PRIV-01 | MUST | §4.4.1, §16.3, §2.5 | Sphinx packet is constant-length on the bucket ladder **{8, 64} KiB**; wrong length rejected (the 2 KiB rung was cut — a conformant PQ envelope, suite `0x02`, exceeds it before any body) | reject → `ERR_MIX_PACKET_MALFORMED` (0x0307) | construction-todo |

---

## Groups & Files level (§5)

Core + MLS groups + content-addressed file transfer. MLS handshake bytes (RFC 9420) are carried
opaquely by DMTAP and are not vectored (README "deferred"); the DMTAP-native Merkle-DAG manifest
(§18.9.5) is deterministic and SHOULD be vectored next.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-GRP-01 | MUST | §5.1, §18.9.6 | `GroupEvent.committer_sig` / `GroupState.committer_sig` verify under the committer's IK-authorized device key | reject → `ERR_PAYLOAD_SIG_INVALID`-class / group check | construction-todo |

| DMTAP-FILE-05 | MUST | §5.5, §18.9.5 | the content address is over **ciphertext**: the **same plaintext** under two **different** per-file keys yields **different** `Manifest.id` (no cross-user/plaintext dedup — CAS-confirmation defense) | match (two distinct roots) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FILE-06 | MUST | §5.5.2, §18.3.7 | a **Referenced** (> 25 MiB) `ManifestRef` missing `durability`, or with an unknown `class` / `cluster-replicated` `replicas < 1` / `pinned` without `retention`, is rejected | reject → `ERR_FILE_MANIFEST_INVALID` (0x080A) | construction-todo |

| DMTAP-FILE-09 | MUST | §5.5.2, §5.5.3, §6.6 | a **Referenced** origin-hold file with no reachable holder and no satisfiable durability contract fails at the file level (distinct from a single missing chunk, 0x0803) | reject → `ERR_FILE_UNAVAILABLE` (0x0809) | construction-todo |

## Legacy level (§7)

Core + gateway inbound/outbound + DKIM delegation.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-LEG-01 | MUST | §7 | a gateway attestation that fails to verify under a trusted key is rejected | reject → `ERR_GATEWAY_ATTESTATION_INVALID` (0x0601) | construction-todo |

| DMTAP-LEG-03 | MUST | §7.11.2, §9.10, §7.12 | an outbound DMTAP→legacy relay from a sender the gateway has neither authenticated (no `GatewayAuthz`/key-registered relationship, §7.12) nor been paid by (no valid postage) is refused — a valid mesh `sender_sig` alone does NOT authorize egress (open-relay prevention) | reject → `ERR_GATEWAY_SENDER_UNAUTHENTICATED` (0x0607), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |

---

## Clients level (§8)

Core + **JMAP**, the node's native (and only) client surface (§8.1). Legacy client protocols
(IMAP/POP/SMTP-submission, CalDAV/CardDAV) are a **gateway** capability (RECOMMENDED, §7.15), not
a node one.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-CLI-01 | MUST | §8.1 | a MOTE renders to/from the native JMAP object model without loss of the fields §8 requires | accept (round-trip) | construction-todo |

---

## Auth level (§13)

Core + DMTAP-Auth login ceremony with origin binding + key-bound sessions; OIDC bridge RECOMMENDED.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |

| DMTAP-AUTH-01 | MUST | §18.9.8, §13.3 | `Assertion.sig` over `DS ‖ BLAKE3-256(det_cbor([rp_origin,nonce,issued_at,exp,aud,scope,cnf]))` under the IK-authorized device key (`scope` is `[]` when absent; inside the signed preimage — scope-binding) | match (sig) | construction-todo |

---

## Deniable 1:1 mode (§5.2.1) — `DENIABLE`

The optional repudiable mode's fail-closed guards and the dedicated-`idk` handshake. The mode is
capability-negotiated (Private-level optional); the reject guards below are MUST **when the mode is
implemented**. No byte-exact vectors yet (Double Ratchet / X3DH use fresh randomness — the
dedicated `idk` change is flagged for re-vectoring, see README "deferred").

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-DENIABLE-01 | MUST | §5.2.1(c), §18.3.10 | a `DeniablePayload` carrying **any** signature field is rejected (a signature would defeat repudiation) | reject → `ERR_DENIABLE_SIGNATURE_PRESENT` (0x040F), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-DENIABLE-02 | MUST | §5.2.1(d), §10.2 | a deniable session to a peer that has **not** advertised `deniable-1:1` is refused; the client surfaces the choice, never silently downgrades | reject → `ERR_DENIABLE_MODE_UNAVAILABLE` (0x040E), REJECT_NOTIFY | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-DENIABLE-03 | MUST | §5.2.1(b), §18.9.10 | a `DeniableMessage` whose Double-Ratchet AEAD tag (shared-key MAC) fails is dropped; substitutes for `Payload.sig` (§20.2 fork) | reject → `ERR_DENIABLE_RATCHET_AUTH_FAILED` (0x040D), DROP_SILENT | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-DENIABLE-04 | MUST | §5.2.1(a), §18.4.8 | an invalid/exhausted `DeniablePrekeyBundle` (`sig`/`spk_sig`/`idk_sig` fail, or no unspent prekey) is rejected | reject → `ERR_DENIABLE_PREKEY_INVALID_OR_EXHAUSTED` (0x040B), REJECT_NOTIFY | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-DENIABLE-05 | MUST | §5.2.1(a), §18.3.9 | X3DH/PQXDH over the **dedicated `idk`** (NOT XEdDSA-from-`IK`): a `DeniableInit` whose `idk_a_cert` does not certify `idk_a` under `ik_a`, or whose key agreement fails, is rejected; last-resort-only first-message replay is caught | reject → `ERR_DENIABLE_X3DH_FAILED` (0x040C) | construction-todo |

## Organization administration (§3.10, §13.5.1) — `ORG`

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|

---

## KT-v1 hardening (§3.5.2) — `KTV1`

Optional (log-type `0x02`, negotiated); the equivocation/quorum guards are MUST **when v1 is
implemented**. RFC 6962-profiled objects (`SignedTreeHead`/`InclusionProof`/`ConsistencyProof`,
§18.4.9–§18.4.11).

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|

## Device attestation (§1.2a) — `ATTEST`

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-ATTEST-01 | MUST | §1.2a, §18.4.2 | an attestation-gated context rejects a device whose `key_protection`/`attestation` is absent or fails against the platform root (advisory — never overrides §1.4 authority) | reject → `ERR_DEVICE_ATTESTATION_INVALID` (0x0116), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-ATTEST-02 | MUST | §1.2a, §18.4.2, §16.9 | evidence older than the re-attestation cadence (≤ 90 d), past its window, or chaining only to a retired root is treated as expired → re-attest | reject → `ERR_DEVICE_ATTESTATION_EXPIRED` (0x0118), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |

---

## Profile — human display data (§3.9.5) — `PROFILE`

The self-asserted, signed display object (`display_name` / name parts / avatar). Signed by the
`IK` (or an `IK`-authorized device key) and authenticated to the key exactly like `Identity.names`
— a replaceable pointer, never a real-world-identity claim. No byte-exact vectors yet (a signed
`Profile` KAT is added when the reference gains the object); the reject guards below are MUST.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-PROFILE-01 | MUST | §3.9.5, §18.4.12, §18.9.3 | a `Profile` whose `sig` (DS-tag `DMTAP-v0/profile`) does not verify under the identity's `IK` / an `IK`-authorized device key is rejected; the prior pinned profile (or the fallback ladder) is used | reject → `ERR_PROFILE_SIG_INVALID` (0x0119), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-PROFILE-02 | MUST | §3.9.5, §18.4.12 | a `Profile` whose `avatar.hash` is present but the bytes fetched from `avatar.url` do **not** content-address (`0x1e ‖ BLAKE3-256`) to it MUST NOT be displayed; the client falls back down the §3.9.5 ladder (key-derived identicon → initials) and warns | reject → `ERR_PROFILE_AVATAR_HASH_MISMATCH` (0x011A), USER_WARN | construction-todo |

---

## Push wake-signaling (§4.9, OPTIONAL) — `PUSH`

The optional wake layer (§4.9): a device registers a `PushSubscription` with its own node, and the
node emits a content-free, sender-blind `WakePing`. Push is **not required for Core** (§10.3) — these
guards are conditional and MUST hold **only when a node implements the optional `push-wake`
capability** (§10.2, §21.22), mirroring how the `DENIABLE` guards apply only when the deniable mode is
implemented. No byte-exact vectors yet (RFC 8291 sealing uses fresh randomness); the reject guards
below are MUST.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-PUSH-01 | MUST | §4.9.1, §18.5.6, §18.9.15 | a `WakePing` carrying any field beyond the opaque sealed token (key `1`) — or whose opened plaintext bears sender/subject/recipient/content — MUST be rejected: a wake is content-free and sender-blind | reject → `ERR_WAKEPING_CONTENT_PRESENT` (0x0313), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-PUSH-02 | MUST | §4.9.1, §4.9.4, §18.5.5, §18.9.15 | a `PushSubscription` whose `sig` does not verify under an `IK`-authorized `device_key` (§1.2) MUST be rejected and never woken against — the subscription must be authenticated to the identity | reject → `ERR_PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_SIG_INVALID` (0x0312), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |

---

## Device-cluster sync (§5.6) — `SYNC`

Level **Groups & Files**. The personal-cluster convergence: mutual-auth membership (§5.6.1),
range-based Merkle backfill + journal replay (§5.6.3), and the OR-Set / HLC-LWW CRDT merge
(§5.6.4). Frames ride inside the encrypted MLS cluster group (§18.6.3); no byte-exact vectors yet.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-SYNC-01 | MUST | §5.6.1, §18.6.3 | a `ClusterSyncFrame`/`ClusterOp` from a device whose `DeviceCert` is absent/invalid or **revoked** (KeyRotation-excluded) under the owner's `IK` is refused — replication is mutually authenticated, a non-member cannot inject or pull | reject → `ERR_CLUSTER_DEVICE_UNAUTHORIZED` (0x0410), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-SYNC-02 | MUST | §5.6.3(a), §18.6.3 | a `recon` summary whose `RangeFingerprint.fp` does not recompute over the receiver's ids in `[lo,hi)` (forged Merkle fingerprint) is rejected and reconciliation re-driven against another peer | reject → `ERR_CLUSTER_RECON_SUMMARY_INVALID` (0x0411), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |

| DMTAP-SYNC-04 | MUST | §5.6.4, §16.10, §18.6.3 | a `ClusterOp` with an unknown kind, an OR-Set remove citing an unknown add-tag, an HLC `wall` beyond the skew bound, or embedding a `DeniablePayload`/its plaintext (§5.2.1) is rejected | reject → `ERR_CLUSTER_CRDT_OP_INVALID` (0x0413), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-SYNC-05 | MUST | §5.6.4 | **convergence (SEC)**: two replicas applying concurrent OR-Set add/remove + per-field LWW ops in **any order** reach the **identical** state — add-wins-over-unseen-remove; the greater HLC `(wall,counter,device)` wins each field deterministically | accept (both replicas converge to the same state) | construction-todo |

---

## Aliases — many names, one key (§3.9.4, §3.11) — `ALIAS`

Level **Core**. Self-asserted aliases require forward verification; each is independently
revocable; every verified alias resolves to the same identity key.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-ALIAS-01 | MUST | §3.9.4, §3.11.3 | a name in the identity's own `Identity.names` whose forward `name → ik` binding (DNS+KT) resolves to a **different** key is rendered unverified and MUST NOT be displayed as authenticated nor used to address mail | reject → `ERR_ALIAS_FORWARD_UNVERIFIED` (0x011C), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-ALIAS-02 | MUST | §3.9.4, §3.11.5 | a **revoked** alias (dropped in a newer signed `Identity`, its binding retired) used off a stale cache to address the identity is refused; the key and the identity's other aliases are unaffected | reject → `ERR_ALIAS_REVOKED` (0x011D), REJECT_NOTIFY | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-ALIAS-03 | MUST | §3.9.4, §3.11.3, §18.4.9 | multiple **verified** aliases (distinct `name`, same `ik`/`identity_id`) resolve to the **same** identity — recognized as one person/one key, pinned per-key | accept (all aliases resolve to one identity_id) | construction-todo |

---

## Pluggable resolver framework (§3.12) — `RESOLVE`

Level **Core**. Resolution is always discover-then-KT-verify (§3.12.1); a resolver never
introduces its own trust root, unknown types fail closed (never guessed), and independent
resolvers must agree on the one key.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-RESOLVE-01 | MUST | §3.12.5(b) | a `name-chain` resolution whose two binding directions **disagree** — an on-chain `name → ik` record naming a key that does not claim the name in its signed `Identity.names`, or a claimed name whose chain record resolves to a **different** key — is rendered unverified and MUST NOT be used to address mail | reject → `ERR_NAMECHAIN_BINDING_UNVERIFIED` (0x011E), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-RESOLVE-02 | MUST | §3.12.2 | a name in a resolver type the verifier does not implement, or that is unregistered, is treated as unresolvable and fails closed — the "unknown ⇒ reject, never guess" discipline; the identity stays reachable via its other resolvers and the key-name (§3.9.6) | reject → `ERR_RESOLVER_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED` (0x011F), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-RESOLVE-03 | MUST | §3.12.3, §3.5.2(b) | two independent resolvers returning **different** `ik` for the **same** name is surfaced as a potential attack, never silently reconciled: the client MUST NOT pin, MUST alert, and MUST fall back to KT-quorum or OOB verification | reject → `ERR_RESOLVER_DISAGREEMENT` (0x0120), HALT_ALERT | construction-todo |

---

## Gateway alias mapping (§7.10) — `GWALIAS`

Level **Legacy**. Native↔legacy bridging via a swappable gateway alias: reversible encoded
local-parts, and legacy→native mapping that fails closed on an unmappable alias.

| id | req | clause | checks | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-GWALIAS-01 | MUST | §7.10.2, §18.3.12 | an `encoded` gateway alias `localpart.nativedomain@gateway.domain` that does not reversibly decode to exactly one `(localpart, nativedomain)` (ambiguous escaping) or exceeds RFC 5321 limits (§16.11) is rejected — the gateway MUST NOT guess a native address | reject → `ERR_GATEWAY_ALIAS_ENCODING_INVALID` (0x0606), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-GWALIAS-02 | MUST | §7.10.3, §18.3.12 | inbound legacy mail to a `random`-mode alias with no live `GatewayAliasMap` row (missing/expired/burned) is answered as "no such user," not silently dropped | reject → `ERR_GATEWAY_ALIAS_UNMAPPED` (0x0605), RETURN_SENDER_SMTP (`550 5.1.1`) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-GWALIAS-03 | MUST | §7.10.2 | the encoded local-part **round-trips**: `encode(localpart, nativedomain)` (escape `-`→`--`, `.`→`-.`, join with a top-level `.`) then `decode` yields the original `(localpart, nativedomain)` — a deterministic KAT (e.g. `imran`+`mydomain.com` → `imran.mydomain-.com` → back) | match (decode(encode(x)) = x) | construction-todo |

---

## Bootstrap mix profile (§4.4.10a) — `MIXPROF`

Level **Private**. The Bootstrap profile exists so a network too small to satisfy Standard's bar is
not non-functional by its own rules (§4.4.10a) — and its four normative constraints exist so the
profile cannot become a permanent silent downgrade. Constraint 3 is the load-bearing one: if
Bootstrap were reachable as a *fallback*, an adversary who DoSes or eclipses enough mixes forces
every sender down onto it, which is exactly the §4.4.9 downgrade attack under a friendlier name.
Constraints 1–2 are in-product UX MUSTs with no wire bytes and are `manual-attestation` (the
`DMTAP-PUB-21` precedent); constraints 3–4 are observable state transitions and map onto the
existing `0x0310`. Bootstrap is announced by the additive capability token `mix-profile-bootstrap`
(§10.2, §21.22); no object gains a field and no vector changes.

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-MIXPROF-01 | MUST | §4.4.10a(1), §4.4.11 | **User-visible degradation.** A client operating on Bootstrap MUST show that metadata privacy is **degraded** and MUST say **why** — how many attested mixes and how many disjoint ASNs the network currently offers **against the Standard bar** (§16.3). Silence converts a temporary shortfall into an invisible one | manual attestation (client-UX review with the node in a fleet below Standard's bar; no wire bytes to recompute) | non-conformant if the degradation is not shown, or is shown without the current-vs-required mix/ASN counts | manual-attestation |
| DMTAP-MIXPROF-02 | MUST | §4.4.10a(2), §4.4.11 | **No anonymity claim in-product.** While Bootstrap is in force, an implementation or operator MUST NOT present the `private` tier as anonymous, MUST NOT report an anonymity-set size, and MUST NOT describe the traffic as unlinkable — §4.4.11's prohibition as a property of the profile itself | manual attestation (in-product copy, status surfaces, and operator-facing material) | non-conformant if any of the three claims appears while Bootstrap is in force | manual-attestation |
| DMTAP-MIXPROF-03 | MUST | §4.4.10a(3), §4.4.2, §4.4.4 | **Auto-upgrade is mandatory.** A node MUST re-evaluate its derived fleet view **each mix-key epoch** and MUST move to **Standard** as soon as Standard's bar is satisfiable (≥ 3 hops one per layer, ≥ 3 disjoint **attested** operators, ≥ 3 disjoint ASNs, guard sample per §16.3). Remaining on Bootstrap with a satisfiable Standard bar is non-conformant — it is a silent permanent downgrade | construction: derived fleet view below Standard's bar at epoch `e` (Bootstrap in force); grow the view to satisfy Standard at `e+1`; step the node's epoch re-evaluation with no user action | accept (in-force profile = Standard from `e+1`, unprompted); non-conformant if it stays on Bootstrap | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-MIXPROF-04 | MUST | §4.4.10a(3), §4.4.9, §10.7.0 | **Never fall back.** Once a node has operated at Standard it MUST NOT return to Bootstrap. If the fleet later shrinks below Standard's bar the sender **holds and retries** (FAIL-QUEUED) and surfaces the refusal past the retry deadline — it MUST NOT rebuild the path at Bootstrap's bar. This is the case that closes "DoS the mixes to force everyone onto the degraded profile" | construction: node at Standard; shrink the derived fleet below Standard's bar (kill attested mixes / collapse ASN diversity); attempt a `private` send | reject → `ERR_PRIVATE_TIER_DOWNGRADE_REFUSED` (0x0310); message stays queued (§10.7.0 FAIL-QUEUED), MUST NOT be carried at Bootstrap's bar and MUST NOT be refused enqueue | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-MIXPROF-05 | MUST | §4.4.10a(4), §1.3, §4.4.9 | **Per-contact ratchet.** Profile level ratchets **per correspondent**, exactly like the §1.3 suite high-water-mark: once any message in a relationship has been carried at Standard (or High-security), a Bootstrap-tier send to that contact MUST fail closed. The granularity is deliberate — a **new** contact on a still-small network MUST remain reachable at Bootstrap in the same fleet state, so the attacker must defeat one relationship at a time | construction: contact **A** with a Standard-carried message in its history and contact **B** never carried above Bootstrap; with the fleet below Standard's bar, attempt a `private` send to each | reject → `ERR_PRIVATE_TIER_DOWNGRADE_REFUSED` (0x0310) for **A**; accept (Bootstrap path built) for **B**; a global rather than per-contact mark fails one branch or the other | construction-todo |

## Derived mix-fleet view (§4.4.2) — `FLEET`

Level **Private**. The mix directory is a **derived view, not an authority-signed artifact**: each
mix publishes its `MixNodeDescriptor` into the KT logs and every client computes the fleet locally
from a `> n/2` quorum of its pinned logs. A signed fleet snapshot would make its signer the most
powerful party in the protocol — it picks the anonymity set, and its silence stops all
`private`-tier mail — so the cases below assert that a served `MixDirectory` is only ever a
**cache**: convenient, verifiable, never load-bearing. `DMTAP-PRIV-02` states the same rule at the
directory level; `-02` here is the per-descriptor MUST NOT.

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-FLEET-01 | MUST | §4.4.2, §3.5.2(b) | **Reconstructable from logs alone.** With **no** served `MixDirectory` available, a client MUST still compute its epoch fleet view from its pinned KT log quorum: the set of descriptors that (i) self-verify under `node_ik`, (ii) carry a valid `_dmtap-mix` operator attestation, (iii) name a current-epoch Sphinx key, and (iv) appear with a valid inclusion proof in `> n/2` of the pinned logs. An implementation that cannot build a `private` path without a served directory has re-created the authority §4.4.2 deleted | construction: populate the pinned log set with `n` descriptors (some failing exactly one predicate); withhold every `MixDirectory` cache; ask the client for its epoch fleet view | accept (derived view = exactly the descriptors satisfying all four predicates; identical to the view derived when a valid cache *is* present) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FLEET-02 | MUST | §4.4.2, §18.5.3 | **A cache is never an authority.** A client MUST NOT accept a served/cached `MixDirectory` containing a descriptor it cannot independently verify against its own log quorum (any of `DMTAP-FLEET-01`'s four predicates failing), and MUST reject a cache whose `version` is older-or-equal to one already accepted (rollback). A hostile cache may withhold or reorder — never inject | construction: cache of valid descriptors plus one whose `_dmtap-mix` attestation does not validate (variant: one absent from the log quorum); and separately, replay a cache at an older `version` | reject → `ERR_MIX_DIRECTORY_SIG_INVALID` (0x030B), FAIL_CLOSED_BLOCK; the unverifiable descriptor MUST NOT enter path selection | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FLEET-03 | MUST | §4.4.2, §10.7.2, §10.7.0, §16.3 | **Freeze defense is FAIL-QUEUED, not fail-closed.** A derived view (or cache) older than the mix-directory freshness window (§16.3, ≤ one mix-key epoch) is **stale**: the client MUST refresh before building any `private` path, and if it cannot obtain a fresh one it **queues and retries**. It MUST NOT downgrade the tier and MUST NOT refuse to enqueue — a directory outage delays mail, it must never stop it | construction: freeze the client's log/cache feed at a view older than the freshness window; submit a `private` MOTE from the user | reject (path build) → `ERR_MIX_DIRECTORY_STALE` (0x0311), FAIL-QUEUED per §10.7.0 — **and** accept (enqueue): the MOTE is durably held and retried; emitting a tier downgrade, or refusing the enqueue, is non-conformant | construction-todo |

---

## Entry guards & path diversity (§4.4.8) — `GUARD`

Level **Private**. Guards and diversity defend **different** attacks and neither substitutes for the
other (§4.4.10): guards bound the long-horizon intersection attack, diversity bounds the
both-ends-adversarial placement. Each case below pins the mechanism that makes the stated bound
true rather than merely stating the bound.

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-GUARD-01 | MUST | §4.4.8, §16.3 | **Guards come from a persistent sampled set, never a fresh fleet draw.** The active `G` guards MUST be drawn only from the node's persistent **guard sample**, chosen once; rotation moves the active guards *inside* the sample and MUST NOT re-sample from the fleet. The sample is refreshed only on exhaustion (sampled nodes permanently offline) or an explicit owner re-sample (a disclosed exposure event). Re-drawing per rotation turns the `(1−f)^G` bound into `(1−f)^(G·r)` — at `G=2`, 30-day rotation, `f=0.05`, a decade is `0.95^244 ≈ 3×10⁻⁷`, i.e. near-certain eventual exposure. This is Tor prop-271's fix | construction: fleet of `N` attested, ASN-disjoint mixes, unchanged throughout; record the node's initial guard sample; advance `r ≥ 10` guard-rotation periods (§16.3) | accept (every active guard at every rotation ∈ the initial sample, and the sample is byte-identical throughout); any guard outside the initial sample, absent exhaustion or an explicit re-sample, is non-conformant | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-GUARD-02 | MUST | §4.4.8, §4.4.9 | **ASN-disjointness in path selection.** A path MUST traverse mixes under **disjoint announced BGP origin ASNs**; a candidate path whose hops carry three distinct *attested* operators but announce from **one** ASN MUST NOT be built. Domains are cheap — attestation proves accountability, not independence — and ASN is the axis rented capacity cannot cheaply diversify | construction: three mixes with distinct, validly-attested `operator` domains, all reachable via addresses announced by a single origin ASN; request a Standard-profile path | reject → `ERR_MIX_PATH_UNBUILDABLE` (0x030D); the sender holds per §4.4.9 (`0x0310` past the retry deadline) and MUST NOT route over the ASN-colliding path | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-GUARD-03 | MUST | §4.4.8 | **An un-attested `operator` claim confers no diversity.** A mix whose `operator` is absent or not backed by a valid `_dmtap-mix` attestation under that domain MUST NOT count as its own operator for the disjoint-operator rule — it is excluded from selection or counted as one unknown/shared operator. Otherwise a single adversary publishes *N* self-claimed operators and collapses the ≈ *a*² compromised-path bound to ≈ *a* | construction: three mixes, each self-asserting a **different** `operator` value, none carrying a resolvable/valid `_dmtap-mix` record; request a Standard-profile path | reject → `ERR_MIX_PATH_UNBUILDABLE` (0x030D); counting the three as three operators is non-conformant | construction-todo |

---

## Location records & resolution order (§4.2, §4.2.1) — `LOC`

Level **Core**. Two properties of the reachability layer that the mixnet's guarantees rest on: a
routing identifier that does not survive its epoch (so a harvested v0-Sphinx corpus resolves to
expired pseudonyms), and a resolution order in which an established relationship performs **no
lookup at all** (so the eclipse attack, which is an attack on lookup, is off the path that matters).

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-LOC-01 | MUST | §4.2, §16.2, §4.4.12 | **`peer_id` is per-epoch unlinkable.** A node MUST derive its `peer_id` **freshly per location epoch** rather than holding one identifier across its lifetime, so a `peer_id` observed at *T* cannot be linked to the same node at *T+Δ* by the identifier alone. This is what bounds the harvest-now-decrypt-later exposure of the routing layer: a route recovered in 2040 names an identifier that expired in 2026 | construction: publish the node's `LocationRecord` for two consecutive location epochs `e`, `e+1` under the same `ik`; both validly signed, `seq` strictly increasing | match (`peer_id(e) ≠ peer_id(e+1)`, both records verify); a stable lifetime `peer_id` is non-conformant | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-LOC-02 | MUST | §4.2.1 | **Piggybacked location precedes every lookup.** A resolver MUST try, in order: (1) the sender's signed `LocationRecord` carried by the MOTE itself, (2) cached direct addresses, (3) the home rendezvous set (≥ 3 disjoint operators), (4) the DHT — opportunistic only, and a DHT-only record is a **hint** (usable to attempt a connection, never to authenticate; identity is authenticated by the pinned `IK` as always). Replying to a MOTE that carried a fresh, valid record MUST perform **no** rendezvous query and **no** DHT lookup | construction: instrumented resolver counting rendezvous/DHT queries; deliver a MOTE carrying the sender's current signed `LocationRecord`, then send a reply | accept (zero lookups of any kind; the piggybacked record is used); any lookup on this path is non-conformant | construction-todo |

---

## Zero-relationship delivery floor (§9.7a, §9.4.1) — `FLOOR`

Level **Core**. §3.13 promises that a user with no domain, no name-chain and no provider is a
first-class identity; that promise is only true if such a user can **deliver**. Unknown-issuer ARC
budget is zero, postage needs an issuer, vouch needs a mutual contact — compose those and a
sovereign key-name identity is nameable, reachable, verifiable and **silently undeliverable**. The
floor is normative precisely because every recipient's *local* incentive is to set it to zero, so
it is a collective-action problem and the conformance suite is the only place to solve it.

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-FLOOR-01 | MUST | §9.7a, §16.5, §2.7a | **The floor delivers.** A recipient MUST accept at least `N_floor` (§16.5, **≥ 5**) cold MOTEs **per sender-key per day** from a sender presenting **only** a valid work proof — a sequential-work `vdf` (§9.4.1) **or** a memory-hard PoW (§9.4) — bound to the recipient's current epoch beacon, with **no** token, **no** postage and **no** vouch. Floor deliveries land in the **requests area** (§2.7a), never the inbox, and are **not** acked (§2.7a, `DMTAP-VAL-12`) | construction: `N_floor` cold MOTEs from one fresh sender key inside 24 h, each carrying a valid proof scoped per §9.2a (incl. `sender_key`) and no other credential; recipient has no relationship with the sender | accept (all `N_floor` durably held in the requests area for the §16.5 retention; none dropped; **no ack** emitted); dropping any of them is non-conformant | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FLOOR-02 | MUST | §9.7a, §16.5 | **A zero floor is a non-conformant policy.** A recipient MAY grant far more than the floor to trusted issuers, vouched senders or paid postage, but MUST NOT grant less: `N_floor = 0` (or below §16.5's minimum) as a **standing** policy — including a shipped default, and including a "reject all unknown senders" configuration offered without the §9.7a disclosure — MUST be refused, not silently clamped. Under active flood the §9.4 deferral budget MAY be applied to floor traffic as to any other; that is a transient budget, not a standing floor of zero | construction: apply a recipient `Policy` (§9.2) with `N_floor = 0`; variant: a policy UI offering "reject all unknown senders" as a reachable configuration with no disclosure | reject → `ERR_POLICY_BELOW_FLOOR` (0x070F), REJECT_NOTIFY — the node MUST NOT apply the policy while reporting conformance | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FLOOR-03 | MUST | §9.4.1, §9.7a, §16.5 | **Memory-hard PoW is the interoperable MUST floor.** A conformant recipient MUST accept a valid memory-hard PoW solution (Argon2id at or above its advertised difficulty, scope incl. `sender_key` per §9.2a) as satisfying its cold-contact requirement, subject only to the §9.4 verification budget and its own rate policy. VDF is the *preferred* cost (SHOULD) because sequential work is the scarcity a compute-rich adversary cannot buy — but it has no IETF standard and no interoperable parameter set, so it cannot be the floor | construction: cold MOTE carrying a valid Argon2id solution at the recipient's advertised difficulty and **no** VDF proof, from a sender with no relationship | accept (routed to the requests area exactly as `DMTAP-FLOOR-01`); rejecting it because it is not a VDF is non-conformant | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FLOOR-04 | MUST | §9.4.1, §9.7a | **VDF-only is a non-conformant policy.** A recipient MUST NOT require a VDF as the *only* acceptable proof. A recipient that would accept only a VDF has made an unstandardized construction the price of contacting it, and a sender that cannot produce the one proof a recipient will take is simply undeliverable — the floor failing in a new way rather than holding | construction: apply a `ChallengeSpec`/policy accepting `vdf` only, such that the valid PoW of `DMTAP-FLOOR-03` would be refused | reject → `ERR_POLICY_BELOW_FLOOR` (0x070F), REJECT_NOTIFY | construction-todo |

---

## Failure classes (§10.7.0) — `FAILCLASS`

Level **Core**. "Fail closed" names three different behaviors — FAIL-CLOSED-AUTH, FAIL-QUEUED,
FAIL-DEGRADED — and conflating them produces a protocol that is secure and unusable. A failure of
*authenticity* must never become a delay; a failure of *liveness* must never become a rejection,
because classifying a liveness failure as fail-closed hands a denial-of-service surface to anyone
who can take a service offline. The governing invariant: **an offline-first store-and-forward
protocol must never be unable to queue.** (`DMTAP-FLEET-03` is the individually-identified
FAIL-QUEUED instance; `DMTAP-MIXPROF-04` is the FAIL-QUEUED-without-downgrade instance.)

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-FAILCLASS-01 | MUST | §10.7.0 | **No liveness failure may prevent enqueue.** Whatever is unreachable — KT logs, the derived fleet view, a postage issuer, the rendezvous set, every peer — a node MUST always be able to accept a message from its own user, hold it **durably**, and keep retrying under the guarantees in force. Email's decisive operational property is that it degrades to *late*, never to *blocked* | construction: partition the node from every external dependency simultaneously; submit a `private`-tier message over the node's native client surface (§8.1); restart the node | accept (message enqueued, still present and still retrying after restart); refusing the submission — for any unreachable dependency — is non-conformant | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-FAILCLASS-02 | MUST | §10.7.0, §21.2 | **Each condition takes exactly its class's disposition.** A FAIL-CLOSED-AUTH condition (a signature that does not verify, a pin mismatch, a log equivocation, a suite below the ratchet) is refused **permanently**: retrying cannot help and MUST NOT be offered or silently performed. A FAIL-QUEUED condition (an external service unreachable *right now*) MUST NOT be surfaced as a permanent rejection before the retry deadline (§16), and MUST NOT weaken any guarantee in the meantime | construction: drive one instance of each class against the same node — a tampered `Payload.sig` (§2.7 step 8) and a stale derived fleet view (§4.4.2) — and inspect the retry queue and the user-facing outcome for both | accept (the `0x0208` condition is permanent, never queued and never offered as retryable; the `0x0311` condition is queued and retried, never presented as a rejection before the retry deadline); either mapping inverted is non-conformant | construction-todo |

## Gateway role boundaries (§7.1b, §7.11.4, §9.11) — `GWROLE`

Level **Legacy**. The gateway is a **legacy adapter**, and these are the two boundaries that keep it
one. (i) It **authorizes** — SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, IP standing, authenticated sender identity,
cold-sender state, rate counters — and **never classifies content**; a gateway that classifies is
permanent by construction, because classification improves with corpus size, never terminates, and
makes everyone's mail depend on a judgement only the operator can make (the measured evidence is in
§9.11: third-party mail-security vendors rank in the top five by MX share while not being mailbox
providers at all). (ii) One binary must never mean one address space: gateway mode terminates
untrusted port-25 connections and runs the most-exploited parsers in mail, so it MUST be a separate
process with no reach into `IK` or the MOTE store. `-02` and `-03` are `manual-attestation`: a
process boundary and a product's user-facing copy have no wire bytes to recompute.

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-GWROLE-01 | MUST | §7.11.4, §9.11 | **Authorize, never classify — differential test.** The gateway's admission decision MUST be a function of its permitted inputs only (SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, sending-IP standing, authenticated sender identity, cold-sender state, rate/volume counters). It MUST NOT run content-based scoring, Bayesian/learned filters, keyword or URL reputation, or attachment-content heuristics, and MUST NOT drop, quarantine, re-rank or annotate on such a basis | construction: two inbound legacy messages from the same authenticated sender inside its rate budget, identical in every authorization input (same envelope sender, same SPF/DKIM/DMARC result, same source IP, same cold-sender state), differing **only** in body/subject content — one carrying canonical spam-corpus text, one benign | accept (byte-identical admission decision, disposition and annotation for both); any divergence between the two is proof of content classification and is non-conformant | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-GWROLE-02 | MUST | §7.11.4, §9.11 | **No filter posture, no decryption for anti-abuse.** A gateway MUST NOT be required to decrypt for anti-abuse purposes and MUST NOT present its authorization checks to users as a spam filter. Classification, where it happens at all, is recipient-side and on-device against the user's own corpus, and a recipient MUST be able to run *no* classifier and still be protected — the §9.1–§9.7a mechanisms are sender-cost and policy mechanisms, not content judgements | manual attestation (review of the gateway's user-facing copy, admin surfaces and operator documentation; no wire bytes to recompute) | non-conformant if the authorization gate is described to users as spam filtering, or if any anti-abuse path requires access to plaintext it would not otherwise hold | manual-attestation |
| DMTAP-GWROLE-03 | MUST | §7.1b | **Privilege separation.** Gateway mode MUST run as a **separate process in a separate privilege domain** (distinct OS user; a distinct container/jail/namespace where the platform provides one) from the node's identity and store processes; it MUST NOT have access to identity key material (`IK`, device private keys, recovery material) and MUST NOT have read access to the local MOTE store. Legacy parsers (SMTP/IMAP/POP3/MIME/iCalendar/vCard) SHOULD be sandboxed further (seccomp/pledge-class filter, per-connection parsing process, or a memory-safe parser). "One binary" is a distribution property, never an isolation property — and the rule holds for a self-operated gateway too, because the threat is remote code execution by a stranger, not the operator | manual attestation (deployment review: process table and uid separation, keystore and MOTE-store access permissions, sandbox profile; no wire bytes to recompute) | non-conformant if gateway mode shares an address space or privilege domain with identity/store, or can read either | manual-attestation |

## DMTAP-PUB (§22) — `PUB`

Level **Core**, optional capability **`pub-1`** (§10.2, §21.22, §21.24b) — the identical treatment
as `PUSH` above: `pub-1` guards are MUST **when a node implements DMTAP-PUB**, never required for
bare Core conformance, and a node that never advertises `pub-1` is never expected to serve or
validate these objects. DMTAP-PUB is additive and capability-negotiated (§22, ROADMAP.md); it
bumps no `Envelope.v`, no DNS `v=` anchor, and introduces no flag day.

Byte-exact vectors live in **[`vectors/pub_vectors.json`](vectors/pub_vectors.json)** — a
**separate file** from `vectors/vectors.json`, generated by
**[`vectors/gen_pub_vectors.py`](vectors/gen_pub_vectors.py)** (a throwaway, deterministic Python
script; fixed Ed25519 seeds, fixed timestamps, fixed plaintext — no randomness), because the
`dmtap-core` reference crate that generates `vectors.json` does not yet implement the DMTAP-PUB
extension (ROADMAP.md "Envoir node `pub-1` serving" is still a follow-up wave). See
`README.md`'s Provenance section for why the two files are kept separate rather than merged, and
run `python3 conformance/vectors/gen_pub_vectors.py > conformance/vectors/pub_vectors.json` to
regenerate `pub_vectors.json` byte-for-byte from the script. A second, independent implementation
of the same formulas — [`vectors/verify_pub_vectors.py`](vectors/verify_pub_vectors.py), which does
not import the generator — cross-checks every committed vector (`python3
conformance/vectors/verify_pub_vectors.py`).

All digests below are **BLAKE3-256 with the v0 `0x1e` content-address prefix** (§18.1.5,
§22.2.2) and **Ed25519** (§18.1.6) — the same suite `0x01` primitives `vectors.json` uses — so a
runner that already implements the Core vector dispatch (README "How an implementation runs the
vectors") needs only two new operations (`pub_manifest_root`, the DS-tagged Merkle tree of
§22.2.2) plus the existing `ed25519_sign`/`content_address`/`det_cbor_decode`-family dispatch to
run every `PUB` case below.

## CAD/Artifact profile (§23) — `CAD`

An **application profile** over DMTAP-PUB, not a new wire mechanism (§23.1): it allocates no
message kind, capability token, DS-tag, or error block. Conformance to this profile is therefore
**additive and orthogonal** to §22/§21 conformance — a node can be Core/`pub-1`-conformant without
ever having heard of this document, and a CAD-aware client is `pub-1`-conformant-by-construction
because it is only ever a consumer/producer of ordinary §22 objects (`ArtifactMetadata` rides
inside an already-signed `pub_announce.meta["artifact"]`, §23.3.1). The 11 checks below are the
**§23.10 conformance checklist**, one case per row, in the checklist's own order. None allocates a
§21 error code (the profile has none); "reject" below means a CAD-aware client/index MUST refuse
to treat the artifact as usable/well-formed, not that a §22/§21 wire error is raised — a
non-CAD-aware §22 node stores and serves the same bytes unaffected (§23.2).

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-CAD-01 | MUST | §23.4, §23.10 CAD-1 | every artifact `pub_announce`'s `ArtifactMetadata` carries a `license` field (SPDX expression); an announce omitting it is malformed for this profile | construction: `ArtifactMetadata` with key 7 (`license`) omitted | reject (profile-level; generic §22 node still stores/serves it) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-02 | MUST | §23.3.4, §23.10 CAD-2 | `formats` contains **at least one** entry | construction: `ArtifactMetadata` with `formats` (key 4) an empty array | reject | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-03 | MUST | §23.3.4, §23.10 CAD-3 | exactly one `formats` entry carries `role = canonical-source` (non-`assembly` kinds) or `role = structure` (`assembly` kind); an `assembly` with no `structure` entry is malformed | construction: two `role=1` entries (ambiguous canonical source); and separately, an `assembly`-kind with no `role=3` entry | reject (both variants) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-04 | MUST | §23.3.4, §23.10 CAD-4 | no `format_id = 3` (glTF/mesh) entry ever carries `role = 1` (canonical-source) — the profile's central integrity guarantee: a lossy tessellation is never the artifact of record | construction: `ArtifactFormat{format_id:3, role:1, manifest_root:<any hash>}` | reject | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-05 | MUST | §23.3.4, §23.10 CAD-5 | every `role = 2` (derived-rendition) entry carries `derived_from_format` (key 4) | construction: `ArtifactFormat{format_id:1, role:2}` with `derived_from_format` omitted | reject | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-06 | MUST | §23.3.3, §23.10 CAD-6 | `units.length_unit` is present and explicit; a client MUST NOT default or infer it | construction: `Units` with key 1 (`length_unit`) omitted | reject (client MUST refuse to interpret geometry; MAY still show name/description/license) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-07 | MUST | §23.3.1, §23.10 CAD-7 | `deprecated = true` is always accompanied by `deprecation_reason` (key 9) | construction: `ArtifactMetadata{deprecated: true}` with key 9 absent | reject (flagged by a CAD-aware index) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-08 | MUST | §23.5, §23.10 CAD-8 | deprecation/yank is expressed **only** as a successor announcement (`supersedes` + `deprecated=true`), never as a deletion — no operation removes a previously published revision | construction: attempt to model "deletion" of a prior revision (no protocol operation exists; a CAD-aware client MUST NOT present one) | reject (no-such-operation; client MUST NOT imply deletion) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-09 | MUST | §23.6.1, §23.10 CAD-9 | assembly children reference exclusively by `pin` (`ref_kind=1`, a `manifest_root`) or `track` (`ref_kind=2`, a `pub_announce` id) | construction: `AssemblyChild.ref_kind` outside `{1,2}` | reject | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-10 | MUST | §23.6.3, §23.10 CAD-10 | a BOM-walking client MUST detect and reject a cycle in an assembly's resolved DAG (a `track` reference can form one across revisions) rather than recurse indefinitely or silently drop it | construction: assembly A `track`s part B; B's publisher later republishes B as an assembly that `track`s back to A; walk A's BOM | reject (abort the walk at the cycle; surface it to the user — never infinite-recurse, never silently drop) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-CAD-11 | MUST | §23.7, §23.10 CAD-11 | no client treats any single index (category/search/workshop) as authoritative over the signed announces/feeds it was derived from | construction: two independently-built indexes over the same feed set disagree (different crawl coverage) | accept (neither index is "wrong"; ground truth is always the signed announces, re-derivable by any client) | construction-todo |

---

## Video/Media profile (§24) — `VIDEO`

An **application profile** over DMTAP-PUB (§24.1), the convergence path for the *vidmesh* protocol.
Like `CAD`, it is **additive and orthogonal** to §22/§21 conformance: a node can be Core/`pub-1`-conformant
without parsing any of it, and a video-aware client is `pub-1`-conformant-by-construction because it only
ever produces/consumes ordinary §22 objects (its metadata rides inside an already-signed
`pub_announce.meta[<key>]`, §24.4.1). The 15 checks below are the **§24.15 conformance checklist**, one
case per row, in checklist order. The profile allocates **no §21 error code** (so "reject" means a
video-aware client MUST refuse to treat the object as usable/well-formed — a non-video §22 node stores and
serves the same bytes unaffected). **The one exception is VID-3/VID-5**, the rendition-derivation statement
(§24.4.4): it *does* have a signable preimage (DS-tag `"DMTAP-VID-v0/derivation"`), so those two become
byte-backed KATs once a fixed-input derivation vector is generated — until then they carry a construction
recipe like the rest.

| id | req | clause | checks | input | expect | status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| DMTAP-VIDEO-01 | MUST | §24.11, §24.15 VID-1 | every `VideoManifest` carries a `license` field (SPDX expression or a profile consent token `all-rights-reserved`/`mirror-freely`/`endorsed-only`) | construction: `VideoManifest` with key 9 (`license`) omitted | reject (profile-level; generic §22 node still stores/serves it) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-02 | MUST | §24.4.3, §24.15 VID-2 | `original` (key 5) is present and is the canonical rendition — a `Rendition` is never the artifact of record | construction: `VideoManifest` with `original` (key 5) omitted; and separately, a client treating a `Rendition.blob` as the source of truth | reject (both variants) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-03 | MUST | §24.4.3, §24.4.4, §24.15 VID-3 | every `Rendition` carries `produced_by` (key 8) and a `derivation_sig` (key 9) that verifies over the derivation statement | construction: `Rendition` with `derivation_sig` omitted; and separately, a `derivation_sig` that fails to verify over the reconstructed statement | reject (not an authorized rendition; MAY be shown labeled as unverified, or dropped) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-04 | MUST | §24.4.4, §24.4.6, §24.15 VID-4 | a rendition is treated as *authorized* only if `produced_by` is the manifest author or holds an unrevoked, unexpired `rendition` delegate grant from the author | construction: a validly-signed `Rendition` whose `produced_by` is neither the author nor a valid delegate | reject-as-authorized (present only as a labeled third-party encoding, never as an equivalent authorized rendition) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-05 | MUST | §24.4.4, §24.15 VID-5 | the derivation statement binds `derived_from`→`rendition.blob` + codec/width/height/bitrate, signed under `"DMTAP-VID-v0/derivation"` by a device key chaining to `produced_by` | construction (signable KAT recipe): `stmt = det_cbor([derived_from, rendition.blob, codec, width, height, bitrate])`; `sig = Sign(dev_key, "DMTAP-VID-v0/derivation" ‖ 0x00 ‖ BLAKE3-256(stmt))`; mutate any tuple element ⇒ signature MUST fail | reject (replayed/mismatched statement); accept (matching) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-06 | MUST | §24.5, §24.15 VID-6 | a video's `channel` (key 10) reference resolves to an announce with the **same `pub`** as the video's author (a video cannot join another identity's channel) | construction: `VideoManifest.channel` naming a `Channel` announce with a different `pub` | reject | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-07 | MUST | §24.4.1, §24.15 VID-7 | `retracted = true` (key 12) is always accompanied by `retract_reason` (key 13) | construction: `VideoManifest{retracted: true}` with key 13 absent | reject (malformed for this profile) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-08 | MUST | §24.7, §24.15 VID-8 | retraction/removal is expressed **only** as a successor `supersedes` announcement (`retracted=true`), never as deletion; a client MUST NOT imply deletion of prior bytes | construction: attempt to model "deletion" of a prior revision (no protocol operation exists) | reject (no-such-operation; retracted bytes remain fetchable, only status changes) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-09 | MUST | §24.6.1, §24.15 VID-9 | a threaded `Comment` with a `parent` (key 3) references the **same `subject`** (key 1) as its parent | construction: `Comment` whose `parent` references a comment with a different `subject` | reject (parent-subject mismatch) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-10 | MUST | §24.6.2, §24.15 VID-10 | a `Reaction` is counted at most once per identity per subject — a later same-author reaction `supersedes` the earlier | construction: two reactions by one identity to one subject, the later `supersedes` the earlier; an index counts both | reject (count the current one only; superseded reactions are discarded) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-11 | MUST | §24.9, §24.15 VID-11 | segmented playback verifies segment/range bytes against the signed rendition's Merkle root; the HLS/DASH playlist is unsigned serving output, never authoritative | construction: a PUB-server-supplied `.m3u8` listing a segment whose bytes do not verify against the rendition root; client accepts on the playlist's say-so | reject (verify against the signed root; the playlist is not an object of record) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-12 | MUST | §24.10, §24.15 VID-12 | live streaming is gated behind the `vid-live-1` capability; a consumer lacking it treats its absence as a fact, not a fault (capability-absence rule §21.22) | construction: a peer that has not advertised `vid-live-1` receives a `LiveManifest`; treats non-support as a parse failure | reject-the-error (absence is unsupported-not-fatal; store the announce, do not low-latency-follow) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-13 | MUST | §24.8, §24.15 VID-13 | view/reaction/trending aggregates are presented as **per-server claims**, never as network-wide truth | construction: a client renders a PUB server's view count as an authoritative global number | reject (label as "views on this server"; a signed tally is worth only the attester's reputation) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-14 | MUST | §24.8, §24.13, §24.15 VID-14 | no client treats any single index (search/recommendation/compliance) as authoritative over the signed announces/feeds it was derived from | construction: two independently-built indexes (or compliance feeds) over the same feed set disagree | accept (neither is "wrong"; ground truth is the signed feeds, re-derivable by any client) | construction-todo |
| DMTAP-VIDEO-15 | MUST | §24.13, §24.15 VID-15 | encrypted-media fields (`keygrant`/`encryption`) do not appear in a public `VideoManifest` — the public profile makes no confidentiality claim | construction: a `VideoManifest` carrying an `encryption`/`keygrant` field | reject (category error; encrypted media belongs to the sealed path §5.5, not this public profile) | construction-todo |

## Vector cross-reference

Every `vectored` case above maps to an existing entry in `vectors/vectors.json`
(**33 of the 68 vectors** in the file are referenced by cases). Cross-check (case → vector):

| vectors.json entry | driven by case(s) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `content_address_empty` / `_small` / `_phrase` / `_multi_kib` | ADDR-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 |
| `mote_content_address_ok` / `_tampered` | ADDR-05 / ADDR-06 (= VAL-02) |
| `ed25519_rfc8032_test1` / `_test2` | SIG-01 / SIG-02 |
| `ed25519_domain_separated` | SIG-03 |
| `ed25519_verify_ok` / `_tampered_msg` / `_tampered_sig` | SIG-04 / SIG-05 / SIG-06 |
| `mote_sender_sig` / `mote_sender_sig_verify` | PRE-01 / PRE-02 (= VAL-03 base) |
| `mote_payload_sig` | PRE-03 (= VAL-08 base) |
| `keyname_zero_key` / `_key_ones` / `_key_twos` / `_real_pubkey` | NAME-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 (-05 derives from -02/-03) |
| `keyname_typo_rejected` | NAME-06 |
| `safety_number_pair_ab` / `_order_independent` | SAFE-01 / SAFE-02 |
| `suite_reject_0x00` / `_0x05` / `_0xff` / `_0x04` | SUITE-01 / -03 / -04 / -07 |
| `suite_accept_0x01` / `_0x02` / `_0x03` | SUITE-05 / SUITE-06 / SUITE-02 |
| `cbor_identity` / `cbor_device_cert` / `cbor_payload` / `cbor_envelope` | CBOR-01 / -02 / -03 / -04 |

No case references a vector that is absent from `vectors.json`. The six `self-contained` CBOR
reject cases (CBOR-05…CBOR-10) carry their bytes inline here and in `suite.json` and need no
reference implementation. The `construction-todo` cases carry a byte-exact recipe and the expected
§21 error; they are wired byte-for-byte as their subsystems gain fixed-input KATs (README
"Coverage vs. deferred").

Every `vectored` `PUB` case maps to an entry in the **separate** file
[`vectors/pub_vectors.json`](vectors/pub_vectors.json) (**all 15 of its 15 vectors** are referenced
by cases — none orphaned). Cross-check (case → vector):

| pub_vectors.json entry | driven by case(s) |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `pub_manifest_single_chunk` | PUB-01 |
| `pub_manifest_three_chunks` | PUB-02 (also the base fixture for PUB-09/-10's construction-todo tamper recipes) |
| `pub_announce_signing_preimage` | PUB-03 (also the base fixture for PUB-12's construction-todo recipe) |
| `pub_announce_id` | PUB-04 (also the base fixture for PUB-11's construction-todo recipe) |
| `pub_feed_entry_chain` | PUB-05 |
| `pub_feed_head_signing_preimage` | PUB-06 (also the base fixture for PUB-17's construction-todo recipe) |
| `pub_manifest_type_incompatibility` | PUB-07 |
| `pub_manifest_key5_forbidden` | PUB-08 |
| `pub_announce_supersede_same_author_valid` / `_cross_author_invalid` | PUB-13 |
| `pub_feed_rollback_strict_less_than` / `pub_feed_equal_seq_identical_tip_idempotent` | PUB-14 |
| `pub_feed_equal_seq_different_tip_fork` | PUB-15 |
| `pub_feed_genesis_carries_prev_malformed` / `pub_feed_nongenesis_missing_prev_malformed` | PUB-16 |

`pub_vectors.json` is generated by [`vectors/gen_pub_vectors.py`](vectors/gen_pub_vectors.py), not
by the `dmtap-core` reference crate (see the `PUB` section above and README.md's Provenance note)
— it is independently re-derivable by anyone with `pip install blake3 cryptography`, no Rust
toolchain required. The `CAD` cases carry no vectors (the profile allocates no wire bytes of its
own, §23.1); all 11 are `construction-todo` recipes over the `ArtifactMetadata`/`AssemblyStructure`
CDDL of §23. The `VIDEO` cases (§24) are likewise `construction-todo` recipes over the
`VideoManifest`/`Rendition`/`Comment`/… CDDL of §24 — with the one exception that
`DMTAP-VIDEO-03`/`-05` (the rendition-derivation statement, §24.4.4) *do* have a signable preimage
(DS-tag `"DMTAP-VID-v0/derivation"`) and become byte-backed KATs once a fixed-input derivation vector
is generated, re-derivable with `blake3` + `ed25519` and no reference implementation.
